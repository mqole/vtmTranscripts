# Club Auspex Episode 8 - Jason and Ash talk about storytelling

### WIP- current captions directly ripped from youtube.

0:02 - [Music]

0:11 - hi i'm ash minik and this is club ospecs

0:14 - we have just watched the finale of

0:17 - season one of new york by night it's

0:18 - very exciting in club aspects usually we

0:21 - speak with the players after each show

0:23 - but today with a very special treat we

0:25 - get to talk to the storyteller

0:28 - jason carl that's me welcome to the club

0:31 - thank you ash it's so good to have you

0:33 - here it's yeah it's lovely to have you

0:35 - i'm excited to ask all the questions and

0:37 - i'm assuming you're going to tell us

0:38 - everything and give away all the secrets

0:40 - and just sure yep

0:42 - okay first most obvious burning question

0:46 - um the book club spin-off

0:50 - when is that happening the kindred

0:52 - kindred book club the kindred book club

0:54 - spin-off i think that i think that might

0:57 - make a really interesting podcast don't

0:59 - you think yeah

1:00 - i just yeah those two characters have

1:04 - teaching each other their ways um

1:07 - i would watch every week for sure for

1:09 - sure uh we'll keep that in mind i'll

1:11 - make a note

1:12 - and we'll see if we can make that happen

1:14 - just for you ash yes

1:16 - on a more serious note

1:18 - we've just finished season one of new

1:20 - york by night

1:21 - it's been quite quite a ride

1:24 - and this is coming off of five seasons

1:26 - in l.a that's right what has it been

1:28 - like for you what has been the biggest

1:30 - difference in telling a new york story

1:33 - versus an la story oh a huge question

1:36 - let me see if i can

1:37 - answer the question that i think you're

1:39 - asking

1:40 - okay

1:41 - um

1:42 - la by night of course uh was you know a

1:44 - joy to

1:45 - to be the storyteller for for five

1:47 - seasons and this is also a joy but the

1:50 - stories are very different we approach

1:52 - them both very differently

1:54 - and

1:56 - i think if i were to highlight three

1:58 - main differences okay between the two

2:01 - it's that

2:04 - this story in new york is very much a

2:07 - street level story it is the bottom most

2:11 - tier of that

2:12 - blood rich kindred layer cake we keep

2:15 - talking about in some of the prologues

2:17 - la by night was a mid-tier story about

2:21 - city-wide

2:22 - sectarian politics and

2:25 - larger

2:26 - story arcs

2:27 - that were very exciting and emotionally

2:30 - rich and rewarding

2:31 - this story also emotionally rich and

2:34 - rewarding but the action takes place at

2:36 - a much much smaller scale

2:38 - so that's one major difference

2:40 - the second major difference is of course

2:42 - the city itself new york and l.a are

2:44 - very different

2:46 - metropoli is that a word

2:49 - it is today it is today metropolis um

2:52 - they're the two largest cities

2:55 - they're the two largest cities uh in the

2:57 - united states and i would love to tell a

2:59 - vampire story someday about cities in

3:01 - other parts of the world but for now

3:03 - we're telling stories that anchor the

3:05 - two coasts of america and the vibe the

3:09 - energy the attitude

3:12 - the people and the problems of each city

3:14 - are super different new york is a

3:15 - completely different character in the

3:17 - story than los angeles was in its story

3:21 - and then finally um of course the the

3:24 - third major difference is and i'm sure

3:26 - we'll talk about this a little bit later

3:28 - is that the story of ali by night

3:30 - followed the same coterie

3:32 - throughout five seasons and we got to

3:34 - see that self-contained story beginning

3:36 - to end

3:37 - this story follows

3:39 - two coderies

3:41 - one anarchy which we've

3:43 - just followed all the way to the end of

3:44 - its first season and then we're going to

3:46 - take a look very soon at

3:49 - a camarilla coterie

3:51 - and see how

3:52 - their story

3:54 - unfolds and after that

3:56 - wow

3:58 - that would be telling

4:00 - yeah and we're going to see camarilla as

4:02 - players for the first time we're going

4:04 - to see camarillo characters in our

4:06 - official world of darkness vampire the

4:08 - masquerade stream for the very first

4:10 - time

4:10 - i'm very excited about that i don't

4:13 - really know how they're going to react

4:14 - to some of the things that i'm going to

4:16 - present to them as opportunities for

4:18 - character decisions because that's

4:20 - really what

4:21 - that's really what i like about

4:23 - storytelling

4:24 - i have no idea what is going to happen i

4:27 - create or try to create

4:29 - opportunities for action moments of

4:31 - decision and

4:32 - who knows what the choices will be

4:35 - the

4:36 - key i think is to just be able to say oh

4:39 - that's your choice great yes and this is

4:42 - what happens

4:43 - there there's a bunch of other new

4:45 - things this season besides just besides

4:47 - just uh you know

4:49 - good getting into the camarilla um and

4:51 - swapping coteries which is very exciting

4:53 - but in the season we've just seen

4:55 - there's also a bunch of new things yes

4:57 - we've got new clans which present new

4:59 - powers

5:01 - do you want to talk about some what it

5:02 - was like to bring some of those sure

5:04 - that was uh that was very exciting and

5:06 - very rewarding

5:08 - when we launched la by night

5:10 - we were trying to focus on a very

5:13 - specific

5:14 - and limited subset of clans

5:16 - and uh

5:18 - here in new york we're expanding a

5:20 - little bit on those available options

5:22 - we're seeing for the very first time a

5:24 - smitsy character played by

5:28 - alex that's isaac at the table and

5:31 - the

5:32 - sumitsi signature discipline their

5:34 - signature power

5:36 - is

5:37 - viscitude which is an amalgam power of

5:40 - of uh two other disciplines and we

5:42 - haven't seen that at the table before

5:44 - i really uh i really appreciate how alex

5:47 - is approaching it because it is every

5:49 - bit as cool and creepy as i ever

5:52 - imagined yeah and then of course

5:56 - mayana is playing

5:58 - seraph who is a ravnos we haven't seen

6:01 - these characters this clan at all before

6:04 - the

6:05 - are the daredevils the wanderers the

6:07 - nomads

6:08 - um

6:09 - they have a very tragic yes they have a

6:11 - tragic story that uh

6:14 - myana's character is just starting to

6:16 - figure out yeah and they have a

6:18 - signature power um another amalgam power

6:21 - called uh symmetry which is the power to

6:24 - create illusions

6:26 - things that are not there

6:28 - and we also saw with abria's character

6:31 - when

6:32 - she she you know got a little hungry

6:35 - some blood resonance yeah yeah we

6:37 - haven't done much with blood resonance

6:39 - before in some of our official

6:40 - chronicles this is the first time we're

6:42 - starting to dabble in it and um

6:44 - what that's all about is that the

6:47 - the world of darkness holds a lot of

6:49 - different and strange secrets of course

6:51 - and one of its secrets is that some

6:53 - mortals perhaps by random chance perhaps

6:56 - not

6:57 - possess blood that is

7:01 - that carries a concentration of specific

7:04 - emotions that are so strong

7:07 - they affect the kindred who drink from

7:09 - them and that's called a dyskraecia the

7:13 - resonance is the

7:15 - the flavor of the blood sanguine or

7:18 - melancholic but the dyscracia is that

7:21 - concentration of emotion the effects can

7:24 - be unpredictable so we saw

7:27 - we saw bria's character

7:30 - try to use

7:31 - one power

7:33 - but

7:34 - the dyscracia that she had just consumed

7:38 - decided

7:39 - perhaps of its own free will or maybe it

7:40 - was just random

7:42 - to manifest as a presence power instead

7:44 - and we'll see more of this as we go on

7:46 - and how did you

7:48 - like do you decide in advance that that

7:50 - there's going to be

7:52 - um

7:53 - that complication you know a human with

7:55 - dysgracia or was it no

7:59 - i decide

8:00 - generally both for the whole chronicle

8:03 - for a season but also for each

8:04 - individual episode i decide on

8:07 - essentially a menu of possibilities

8:08 - remember i talked about opportunities

8:10 - for action

8:11 - and i knew that one of the opportunities

8:13 - for action would be

8:16 - a character that or an npc that had a

8:18 - resonance in their blood and that would

8:20 - have a dysgra but i didn't decide where

8:22 - to use it when to use it how to use it

8:24 - or what the resonance and discretion

8:27 - would be i waited for

8:29 - the chance the opportunity that this i

8:30 - knew the story would present itself

8:33 - to me and i was right it did i think

8:36 - abria presented a lot of opportunities

8:38 - right away all the play all the players

8:40 - have abria and mayana alex and joey

8:44 - have been just marvels at the table

8:47 - they have presented an extraordinary

8:48 - number of opportunities too many to

8:50 - pursue really

8:52 - yeah it's uh it's been very fun to watch

8:54 - though

8:55 - for me too the trouble they get

8:57 - themselves into

8:59 - and how it plays out um speaking of of

9:02 - them presenting opportunities i thought

9:04 - you were going to talk about trouble

9:05 - okay well potentially

9:07 - so i know i know how much you prep um

9:10 - and you obviously came into the season

9:13 - with a story in mind absolutely how has

9:16 - that story changed based on what your

9:18 - players have done and where they've

9:20 - taken it well i will be interested to

9:23 - see if our if our audience if our family

9:28 - can pinpoint from watching the season

9:31 - the exact moment where i realized

9:34 - okay the story is going in an entirely

9:37 - different direction and i am unprepared

9:40 - and now we are going to have to do a

9:43 - little uh improvisation even more than

9:45 - usual so yes of course the story

9:47 - departed drastically from where i

9:49 - thought it was going to go i designed

9:50 - this particular

9:53 - season i thought it would be

9:55 - when i designed this particular season i

9:57 - thought it would be more mission based i

9:58 - thought that

10:00 - having

10:01 - gotten in trouble with richter the uh

10:04 - the the crime brouha

10:06 - uh of the

10:07 - south bronx that um episodes would be

10:10 - organized more or less around paying

10:12 - their rent to him doing you know doing

10:15 - doing services for him doing favors and

10:18 - the complications that would arise but

10:21 - of course what happened was they did one

10:25 - task one mission to pay their rent and

10:29 - well here we are you've seen what

10:31 - happened yeah

10:33 - okay well we did a job i guess that's

10:34 - all the jobs we have to do now i know i

10:36 - love that i want to make it very very

10:38 - clear that i love it when players

10:40 - surprise me and i realize oh the story i

10:43 - thought i was telling not the story i am

10:45 - now telling for me that's a very

10:47 - satisfying part of doing this yeah and

10:50 - then and then seeing where it goes

10:52 - and

10:53 - um another thing i know that you you

10:55 - spend a lot of time prepping is your

10:56 - npcs and

10:58 - sure i love how

11:01 - different

11:02 - each of those characters are i mean you

11:03 - play

11:04 - so many different people and kindred and

11:08 - but each of them has such a specific

11:09 - personality and cadence and it's it's

11:11 - lovely to watch i would like to know how

11:14 - you prep that you know is

11:17 - okay

11:18 - some i do not prep okay you never know

11:21 - excuse me you never know what npc is

11:23 - going to be needed in a given episode so

11:26 - you can try to create a menu of options

11:29 - and sometimes that's just a bulleted

11:31 - list of names and you know an adjective

11:34 - and that works but you don't know what

11:35 - their personality is their voice or

11:37 - anything like that and you simply have

11:38 - to create it on the fly and then you

11:39 - have to hope that if that npc ever shows

11:42 - up again you will remember what you did

11:45 - which is a problem for me uh working

11:47 - memory is always an issue for me

11:49 - um

11:50 - some however you wouldn't know it

11:52 - wow that's very kind yeah i you know i

11:55 - hardly remember what i had for breakfast

11:57 - um but i can tell you what i did like

11:59 - you know 10 years ago

12:01 - the um other npcs though that i think

12:03 - will play a major role in the story like

12:07 - like richter at the cage and some

12:10 - members of his codery like

12:12 - consuela and lizzie or francis the thin

12:16 - blood

12:17 - or

12:18 - vaclav the enigmatic sire of isaac those

12:22 - i try to prep um a little bit more some

12:25 - a lot more uh if i want a particular

12:28 - sound or tone or accent i'll watch

12:31 - language instruction videos to try to

12:33 - get

12:34 - some semblance of the right sound um i

12:38 - spent a lot of time creating

12:40 - plausible backstories and thinking about

12:43 - when the characters

12:45 - that we love in our codery are not on

12:47 - the camera

12:49 - what are these npcs doing because their

12:51 - own lives go on

12:54 - regardless of whether or not we're

12:56 - interacting with them so when we see

12:57 - them again things have happened to them

13:00 - and they have done things

13:01 - yeah

13:02 - yeah i have to prep that because i will

13:04 - not be able to invent all that on the

13:06 - fly

13:07 - and some of the mpcs you don't

13:09 - necessarily invent at all they're canon

13:11 - right oh that's absolutely we we have

13:14 - seen uh in this in this season uh we

13:17 - have seen um one important npc that's

13:19 - canonical and that's uh julia

13:21 - and julia is a lasombra who

13:24 - features prominently in one of the

13:27 - narrative video games uh developed and

13:29 - published by draw distance which is a

13:32 - world of darkness licensee shadows of

13:34 - new york and we saw her in 107 with

13:36 - joey's character

13:38 - yeah and um

13:40 - how much do you pull from or does this

13:43 - story play into those games or the books

13:46 - well there are two games set in new york

13:47 - in our in our story universe in the

13:49 - world of darkness and they are coteries

13:50 - of new york and shadows of new york and

13:52 - they're both by uh draw distance um our

13:55 - partner and um this story is certainly

13:58 - um

13:59 - inspired by those games those stories

14:02 - the

14:04 - coderies of new york story is in the

14:06 - past it has already happened

14:08 - players who are familiar with it who

14:10 - have enjoyed it

14:11 - can probably see some of the influences

14:14 - that i've chosen to bring into this

14:16 - story and they've certainly heard about

14:17 - some of the major players like baron

14:20 - tork or boss callahan

14:23 - prince panhard

14:26 - and

14:28 - shadows of new york

14:29 - the sequel is taking place

14:32 - at exactly the same time as this story

14:35 - those events are playing out in the

14:37 - background and we have heard a little

14:38 - bit about them

14:40 - through the voices of some of the npcs

14:42 - but those events live on their own for

14:46 - the enjoyment of our of our

14:48 - audience our family who want to play

14:49 - them uh so if you play the game we learn

14:52 - secrets about

14:54 - this game

14:56 - will you learn secrets

14:58 - or is it just more

15:00 - enriching the world and learning more

15:01 - about

15:03 - if you play those games

15:05 - you will certainly have a better

15:06 - understanding of some of the things that

15:08 - are happening particularly in the

15:09 - background

15:11 - but i wouldn't necessarily say that

15:12 - there are secrets to be learned okay

15:15 - but unless i change my mind

15:18 - that is really fun though that it's you

15:20 - get to play kind of in the same world at

15:22 - the same time and then and then see

15:25 - at least peripherally some of it in the

15:27 - show

15:28 - that's fun

15:30 - i i think i think those two games are

15:32 - really fantastic

15:33 - examples of their kind the narrative

15:36 - you know

15:37 - the

15:38 - sort of choices that you have to make as

15:40 - the player in those games are fun and

15:43 - scary sometimes and a little bit

15:46 - visceral depending on what you do

15:48 - and um they've been a great inspiration

15:50 - for me in this story yeah

15:52 - and then there's also some npcs that you

15:54 - don't play that we we bring in guests

15:57 - and we've had some amazing guests this

15:59 - season we even had a previous player

16:01 - character become an npc that's right so

16:03 - how do you choose which npcs are going

16:06 - to be a guest versus

16:08 - you i mean how

16:10 - well it's not easy and unfortunately i

16:12 - have a lot of great help from people

16:13 - like yourself

16:15 - and

16:16 - our you know our producer saks

16:18 - and we talk about you know where is

16:21 - there an opportunity to really deepen

16:23 - the story

16:25 - for the benefit of both of our players

16:27 - and

16:28 - for our audience

16:29 - and who are watching at home we look for

16:33 - characters who have agendas of their own

16:36 - and we look for characters whose agendas

16:38 - can live

16:41 - who can live going that can live going

16:42 - forward even if the guest who plays them

16:45 - isn't on in every episode so for example

16:48 - we saw simone this season we saw

16:51 - cat costello we saw bree and those

16:54 - characters all have their own thing

16:56 - going on they've all got their own

16:58 - interests and their own ambitions

17:00 - hopes desires and dreams and each of

17:02 - them um

17:04 - deepened and enriched our story

17:07 - at the same time as advancing plot yeah

17:10 - and they were all so amazing and

17:12 - we are extraordinarily lucky in our

17:14 - guests do you think we'll see any of

17:16 - them again i think statistically there

17:18 - is a one in one chance we will see some

17:20 - or all of them again

17:22 - okay all right i'll tune in for that

17:25 - um speaking of seeing them again

17:27 - and this is where we start to maybe talk

17:29 - about what we're gonna see next season

17:33 - before i do i want to mention that one

17:35 - of the guests we brought on was

17:37 - annabelle played by erica ishii

17:40 - who appeared

17:42 - in one of the episodes this season

17:44 - and that is a very special connection

17:46 - between of course the la by night story

17:49 - and um

17:50 - new york by night

17:52 - and working with erica again uh

17:55 - was really

17:57 - i wouldn't i wouldn't go so far as to

17:59 - say dream like but it was it was pretty

18:01 - dreamy um

18:03 - she inhabits that role so thoroughly she

18:06 - knows exactly who and what annabelle is

18:09 - particularly after the events of the

18:11 - fifth season of valley by night the

18:12 - final season and um

18:15 - she was able to help us bridge the gap

18:17 - between those continuities so now we see

18:20 - these stories do take place in the same

18:22 - story universe and the events of one can

18:25 - in fact influence the events of the

18:27 - other so we're very grateful to erica

18:28 - for coming in and helping us make that

18:30 - happen yeah and that was i mean that was

18:32 - very fun and when erica was here um in

18:35 - in maybe that exact chair um we spoke

18:38 - with her about how when she started she

18:41 - was going her character was going

18:42 - through a lot of what these characters

18:43 - are going through and now she's coming

18:45 - in

18:46 - sort of as as as the teacher almost um

18:49 - in this odd parallel and i wonder if

18:52 - if you had any

18:54 - feelings about seeing

18:56 - you know the character from season one

18:58 - and where that was and where la by night

18:59 - was so long ago

19:01 - now come in after this character has

19:03 - gone through this massive arc and

19:05 - that juxtaposition between you know the

19:08 - sort of vampire babies than the new the

19:11 - new babies as it were to be honest it

19:13 - was very satisfying to see this uh this

19:15 - character played so definitely by erica

19:18 - who was once

19:19 - ev in a worse position i dare say than

19:21 - they are now with so little

19:23 - understanding of what they had become

19:26 - and what they were supposed to do and

19:27 - how they could exist

19:29 - and

19:30 - to see

19:31 - annabelle now in a position of being

19:34 - able to

19:35 - save other characters from the same

19:37 - terrible fate

19:39 - was very satisfying for me

19:41 - and

19:42 - i think that

19:43 - if and when we see annabelle again

19:45 - things will have happened to her

19:47 - that will probably continue her story

19:49 - arc and inform the choices she makes

19:52 - when she uh meets uh the characters of

19:54 - new york by night again yeah and

19:56 - hopefully when i feel like there's not

19:57 - enough episodes because i want to see

19:58 - everybody all the time there never are

20:00 - yeah

20:01 - um okay so now will you tell me what's

20:03 - going to happen next season

20:06 - no oh

20:07 - because i don't know

20:09 - okay i know where i know where next

20:11 - season starts i know where season two

20:13 - begins we're going to shift our focus

20:15 - we're going to go from the streets of

20:17 - the bronx and we're going to go into

20:21 - manhattan and in that borough we're

20:23 - going to see a very different side of

20:26 - kindred existence with the camarilla

20:28 - characters

20:29 - and the adventures of that particular

20:31 - coterie their story will be its own

20:33 - unique thing

20:36 - i've been asked many times already will

20:37 - these will these

20:39 - stories cross over and

20:42 - of course they will

20:44 - but they will do so in ways that i

20:46 - cannot predict and

20:48 - that i really can't i can't know in

20:51 - advance what will happen i think it's

20:53 - safe to say that wherever that story

20:55 - starts

20:57 - and

20:58 - what direction it goes in it too will

21:01 - finish in a different place than i'd

21:02 - planned

21:03 - and is it a linear timing-wise does does

21:06 - that season start off where this one

21:08 - left off timing-wise or is it oh that's

21:11 - a great question i will uh i will

21:14 - actually i guess i will offer a secret

21:16 - something

21:17 - that isn't known to anybody but me okay

21:19 - they overlap starting at a particular

21:22 - point in this season

21:23 - so then they go forward so are we going

21:25 - back in time a little bit

21:28 - not long but a little that's fun

21:31 - um

21:32 - but that is

21:33 - with the camarilla uh versus an anarch

21:37 - coterie

21:38 - um just

21:40 - do you feel like there's gonna be a big

21:41 - difference in tone

21:43 - i think so yes um

21:45 - the anarchs are as i said well both

21:47 - stories are at the street level because

21:49 - all the characters uh in both seasons

21:51 - are fledglings very young

21:53 - but um the camera is of course um

21:57 - you know it's this terrible dark blood

21:59 - conspiracy of the night

22:01 - and it has rules and hierarchies and

22:04 - expectations and so

22:06 - uh while it might seem that the camera

22:08 - characters um come into their embraces

22:12 - with more advantages

22:15 - they are at the same time perhaps more

22:17 - constrained in the range of choices that

22:20 - they can

22:21 - that they can take

22:23 - depending on whether or not they get

22:25 - caught yeah

22:26 - i think that we're going to see a very

22:28 - different side

22:29 - of vampire the masquerade here

22:32 - i'm very excited to see it

22:34 - i am too

22:35 - jason thank you so much thank you ash
