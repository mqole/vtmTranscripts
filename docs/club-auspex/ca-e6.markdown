1:23 - really enjoyed having you at the table

1:24 - as well thank you very much it was a lot

1:27 - of fun for me too honestly

1:29 - and you you've played vampire before um

1:32 - on streams etc have you played uh

1:35 - all in person vampire or over i've never

1:38 - played vampire in person so it's all

1:39 - about the only world of darkness game i

1:41 - ever got to play in person was hunter

1:43 - so um and i didn't play vampire until

1:46 - i think i played the first time like six

1:48 - to eight months ago

1:49 - i've always wanted to but i've never had

1:51 - a game to play so so how was playing in

1:53 - person with with this crew

1:56 - really cool it was really fun i had a

1:58 - blast like i i was like trying hard not

2:01 - to nerd out the entire time it was so

2:03 - much fun

2:05 - and it's we've been really lucky this

2:06 - season we've had some really amazing

2:08 - npcs and each of them have been so

2:09 - different joey how is it for you with

2:12 - each of the npcs coming in bringing such

2:14 - a different vibe

2:15 - like

2:16 - it's so hard to know what to expect

2:19 - from people coming up like annabelle's a

2:21 - very established character and so like

2:24 - knowing

2:25 - a little bit about what erica is going

2:27 - to bring to the table but then she

2:28 - knocks it out of the park and then

2:29 - everyone else who's come in has just

2:31 - been like i have no idea what's going to

2:32 - happen when they open their mouth

2:34 - and then they say something i'm

2:36 - instantly enraptured by you know what's

2:38 - going on like the energy just comes in

2:40 - at 11 and i'm like oh [ __ ] i'm playing a

2:42 - character

2:46 - [Music]

2:47 - [Laughter]

2:49 - is it is it hard for you to not just

2:51 - react as as joey there

2:54 - there's

2:55 - a few times where

2:56 - i will just drop my head because i'm

2:58 - smiling so much

3:00 - uh and uh yeah it's it's happened a few

3:03 - times and i'm trying i'm trying to fight

3:04 - it trying to fight it

3:07 - well it felt like from watching that you

3:10 - vibe really well and got in there really

3:12 - well i feel like i if if i were coming

3:14 - in i i might uh feel odd being the sort

3:17 - of person who hasn't been playing them

3:19 - playing with them now there's six

3:21 - episodes in so you guys have a rapport

3:23 - and you're coming in and that's kind of

3:24 - a an interesting bar to have to get over

3:27 - is is to sort of create an immediate

3:29 - rapport with not only the characters

3:31 - don't know each other but you're meeting

3:33 - some of the folks for the first time

3:34 - today

3:36 - did you find that that was easy or was

3:38 - it a struggle or did you feel like it

3:39 - you just meshed immediately um

3:42 - i think that it went pretty well

3:43 - immediately like obviously i was sitting

3:46 - there like waiting for the time to come

3:48 - in and that was a little nerve-racking

3:49 - it's like oh god what is it going to be

3:50 - when is it going to be my anxiety's up

3:52 - i'm trying to focus on everything so i

3:54 - know what's going on um but no um it was

3:57 - pretty easy uh i think that at this

4:00 - point i've done like a few guests

4:03 - things with different games not this is

4:05 - my first one in person but like it's

4:08 - usually pretty easy to get a feel for

4:10 - the vibe at the table as long as you're

4:12 - paying attention to like body language

4:14 - and like how other people are

4:16 - interacting with each other and figure

4:17 - out where you slot in

4:19 - um

4:20 - like that's that's usually a fun part of

4:22 - guesting for me yeah an added layer of

4:24 - challenge i guess

4:26 - speaking of body language we had some

4:28 - body changing happening from both of

4:30 - y'all today

4:31 - especially in the in the eyes getting a

4:34 - little with uh you've got snake eyes and

4:36 - then mr shark over here yeah snake has

4:39 - in short guys

4:41 - um

4:42 - is it is there is there something when

4:43 - you're creating a character where you

4:45 - you look at something like oh this turns

4:47 - this changes my eyes the shade is part

4:48 - of me where part of you is like oh i've

4:50 - got to do that

4:51 - like i just feel like it'd be very cool

4:53 - to

4:54 - have snake eyes or turn into a shark i

4:56 - would definitely pick that on purpose

4:58 - there was a very very small part of me

5:00 - that originally when we started wanted

5:02 - to just wear sclera's the whole time and

5:04 - have shades and then when that moment

5:07 - finally came just pull them down for the

5:08 - first time and i was like there's no way

5:10 - i can do it and i've literally never

5:12 - worn contacts in my life and sclera's

5:14 - are not the place to start yeah

5:17 - and you can't really wear them for more

5:18 - than four hours at a time your eyes

5:20 - would die yeah and you would have been

5:22 - in shades for five and a half episodes

5:24 - basically which is you know what

5:26 - not as long as i thought it was gonna be

5:28 - that's true you're kind of squishing

5:31 - them together yeah

5:33 - so

5:34 - let's talk about the pit

5:36 - um and what was going through

5:39 - joey's head and ray's head

5:42 - what what

5:43 - what well so that's my question joy what

5:46 - yeah so contrary to

5:49 - uh the evidence

5:51 - rey is not the biggest fan of fighting

5:55 - uh

5:56 - rey himself wants to kind of preserve

5:59 - the part of him that is human and he

6:01 - never really fought as a human

6:03 - he was

6:04 - more or less a white-collar criminal uh

6:07 - didn't really get his hands all that

6:09 - dirty and now has the ability to but

6:12 - every time he does it means he's giving

6:14 - in to something

6:16 - and he has very little uh you know

6:19 - ability to resist that

6:21 - so

6:22 - this was kind of gonna be his moment to

6:25 - prove to himself that he

6:27 - could

6:28 - keep the beast at bay

6:30 - and i went into that pit thinking that i

6:32 - wasn't to throw a punch and just get

6:34 - beat up

6:35 - and get dragged out of the pit and be

6:38 - like oh buddy you lost the fight and be

6:39 - like no no i won the fight in here

6:42 - and then i did that one roll best your

6:43 - failure and i'm like

6:46 - dice had other plans guys had other

6:47 - plans

6:48 - can i say i in watching it was excited

6:51 - that you

6:52 - that ray gave in to his gang girl

6:54 - finally yeah yeah and it's just like the

6:56 - well once it happens it's like okay this

6:58 - is where we're going yeah you might as

6:59 - well

7:00 - roll with this tied yeah just to see

7:02 - that uh

7:03 - it

7:04 - yeah

7:05 - i enjoyed it

7:06 - and then you're sick

7:09 - i like drama if you're sick i'm sick i

7:12 - loved it i ate that [ __ ] up with a spoon

7:15 - and then simone interfered or intervened

7:18 - i should say in the pit what was the

7:21 - so simone is in some ways prone to

7:27 - flights of fancy or like not that she

7:31 - doesn't play the long game because she

7:32 - very much does but like

7:34 - these people

7:36 - were folks that she met once the night

7:38 - before and then they came in and visited

7:41 - her and were you know talking and like

7:43 - she finds them interesting and one of

7:46 - them goes down to fight and it's this

7:48 - massive nose for out to with short

7:50 - little legs and a huge torso um

7:53 - and is sort of like

7:55 - this doesn't bode well

7:57 - for

7:59 - what could be an interesting storyline

8:02 - i'm going to involve myself just to see

8:05 - where this one goes

8:08 - you know

8:09 - that and how did ray feel about that

8:13 - well i think

8:15 - ray kind of lost a lot of you know

8:17 - agency

8:18 - once once that that fight started and it

8:20 - was just focused on you know

8:23 - not killing someone and and simone's

8:26 - involvement

8:28 - almost made this

8:30 - a moment of diabetes uh because

8:34 - giving that having that nosferatu still

8:36 - have a chance in the fight

8:38 - would have at least meant that like a

8:40 - fledgling vampire oh he's you know

8:43 - feral in front of you he might have

8:45 - still beat me but the second everyone

8:47 - else starts to get involved it's like

8:50 - now it's on ray to make sure that this

8:52 - fight doesn't end poorly yeah which

8:55 - is honestly a less

8:58 - less uh you know foregone conclusion

9:02 - and we've talked about rey before and

9:05 - his

9:06 - outbursts and you know and how in

9:09 - building the character you created a

9:11 - character that is very

9:13 - on the cusp of yeah of angry outbursts

9:16 - and i think that's really interesting

9:17 - that morally he doesn't like fighting

9:20 - and you've created a character that is

9:22 - almost always angry or at least has

9:25 - difficulty controlling that and so it's

9:27 - sort of a constant

9:28 - battle

9:29 - um that you've created for yourself you

9:31 - know uh so you know if if i'm sick

9:34 - you're sick i think is what i'm saying

9:35 - but yeah yeah because you've created

9:37 - that drama for us well it was kind of

9:40 - just from the the fact that you know

9:42 - when a lot of characters get built you

9:45 - talk about who they were before and who

9:46 - they are now

9:48 - and it

9:49 - you know often conveniently

9:51 - fits you know their background

9:54 - fits who they've become and part of that

9:56 - is you know the nature of the embrace

9:57 - and you kind of talked about it of like

10:00 - why simone was embraced uh and that

10:02 - becomes like a tool

10:04 - but

10:06 - with

10:07 - rey

10:08 - his embrace has nothing to do with who

10:10 - he was and he would much better be

10:13 - suited as something like ventrue

10:16 - and he doesn't get that opportunity he

10:18 - gets to be gangrel and there's you know

10:21 - he's now at odds with what he used to be

10:23 - good at which was

10:25 - talking to people and manipulating

10:26 - people and now he just doesn't have the

10:28 - patience for it yeah and he's sort of

10:30 - becoming everything he's never wanted to

10:32 - be

10:33 - yeah yeah which is is interesting and

10:35 - you built that from scratch persephone

10:37 - your character was

10:39 - somewhat given to you by jason he uh

10:42 - defined your clan and a little bit of

10:44 - the background um

10:46 - how is it different coming into it with

10:48 - a character that's given to you how much

10:51 - do you add to make it yours plenty um

10:54 - this is like

10:55 - well this is a second in person game

10:57 - where i've been handed a character and

10:58 - was told do this thing um which was how

11:01 - the seven started too um but like so

11:04 - jason and i first had a meeting and then

11:06 - he sent me the write up for it

11:08 - and through the write-up i was like okay

11:10 - how do i get into this character like

11:12 - what's

11:13 - what are the real reasons she's like

11:14 - this how does she feel about different

11:16 - aspects of her backstory how does that

11:18 - feel who she is just sort of get into

11:19 - the character itself and that you know

11:22 - builds more depth into it than just what

11:24 - the write-up is so that's sort of how i

11:26 - went about it getting into who simone is

11:29 - how much was given to you of the

11:30 - character versus um back story like how

11:34 - they were embraced what they were before

11:37 - what their purpose was this night

11:40 - and sort of some of their relationships

11:43 - okay yeah

11:44 - and

11:44 - i i mean i felt like the character was

11:47 - very much

11:48 - you know

11:50 - you owned it you know it felt like a

11:52 - very full character so i was interested

11:53 - to see how much was you adding on versus

11:55 - just embracing what was handed to you

11:57 - well what um so in jason's words it was

12:00 - terrifying when i told him that when he

12:01 - handed me this character i was like oh

12:03 - so it's me with power i can do that

12:06 - me with power okay

12:08 - and how is it playing a member of the

12:10 - ministry um you know it's interesting

12:12 - i've actually only ever played toriadore

12:14 - before because i am extra um

12:17 - and like

12:18 - on the surface like simone could read as

12:21 - a very torador-style character but she

12:23 - was embraced by the ministry which is

12:25 - you know the former settings

12:27 - um and i think that their

12:29 - her sort of take on corruption and the

12:32 - idea of like corrupting someone's

12:35 - humanity or something like that is like

12:40 - the

12:41 - transformation of something useless into

12:43 - something

12:44 - beautiful and useful

12:46 - and that's freedom and autonomy and

12:49 - that's you know

12:50 - basically viewing this corruption as a

12:54 - force of

12:57 - self-actualization

12:58 - like realizing who you really are

13:00 - and using that to further

13:03 - what you want

13:04 - and more than that who you want to

13:06 - protect and what you want to

13:09 - hold in your own life i suppose

13:12 - um

13:13 - and i guess you were saying earlier part

13:15 - of what even though it was just sort of

13:16 - an interesting story that she wanted to

13:18 - follow part of

13:19 - who simone wanted to protect was was rey

13:23 - i

13:23 - i

13:24 - i wonder coming into it from simone's

13:26 - point of view

13:27 - what

13:28 - her reactions to this codery were what

13:31 - makes them special

13:33 - there is something

13:34 - to their newness

13:37 - um i think like simone i think i hinted

13:39 - at this in the conversation but there's

13:42 - something

13:44 - so

13:45 - almost endearing like a full learning to

13:47 - walk about like newly embraced

13:51 - vampires and even though simone is an

13:53 - old herself

13:55 - she is in a position of

13:58 - pretty awesome power like in the in new

14:01 - york um

14:02 - and like

14:04 - seeing that and seeing like how they

14:05 - could grow it's just something that

14:07 - really intrigues her plus there's like

14:10 - there's certain connections to certain

14:12 - background things that we can get into

14:14 - um and like also

14:17 - just

14:20 - she is

14:21 - innately self-centered

14:24 - curious

14:25 - and giving which you would think that

14:27 - self-centeredness and giving being

14:29 - giving would be

14:30 - opposed but they're not because

14:33 - even when she's serving her own interest

14:36 - even when the gifts she's giving serve

14:38 - her own interests and amusements she's

14:40 - still giving them and she still chooses

14:42 - to give them

14:44 - you know yeah

14:46 - it's

14:47 - it's interesting like delving into the

14:49 - depth of a vampire and it's just you

14:52 - there's

14:53 - they're all very different like people

14:55 - very much so

14:56 - um joey i have to ask because ray has

14:59 - had some really

15:01 - really interesting interactions with

15:03 - each of the codery you know he's he's

15:05 - butted heads with isaac um about isaac's

15:08 - school he's uh butted heads a bit with

15:12 - um i don't know if it's necessarily

15:13 - butting heads but with

15:15 - um

15:16 - you know

15:16 - my honest character was

15:18 - you know telling her she needs to have

15:20 - more worth and then we've had some some

15:22 - interesting moments with fuego

15:25 - um so

15:27 - how is ray feeling about his codery

15:28 - right now

15:32 - rey is learning to like his codery the i

15:34 - think the biggest thing is that he has a

15:36 - lot of things that he feels he has to do

15:38 - himself

15:39 - [Music]

15:41 - and

15:43 - there he's willing to help the coterie

15:46 - but when it comes to something that he

15:47 - needs to do for himself like

15:52 - doing it yourself is almost as important

15:54 - if not more important than getting it

15:56 - done yeah uh and so like you know

16:00 - serif coming in and trying to help in

16:02 - the pit

16:03 - was immediately

16:05 - something that like

16:06 - ray couldn't

16:08 - really handle her process

16:10 - um and there's no good way to like

16:14 - help someone like deal with their own

16:16 - inner issues like especially if they

16:18 - like what is giving themself worth is

16:21 - them being able to overcome it yeah

16:23 - that's a really hard conversation to

16:25 - have with anybody

16:26 - especially in a tense moment yeah and

16:29 - there's a lot of journeys happening with

16:30 - each of the characters individually that

16:32 - seem like it's it's almost pushing them

16:35 - apart you feel like this is just going

16:36 - to make you all stronger or

16:38 - i think this is like

16:40 - that's kind of one of the fun things

16:42 - about

16:43 - vampire is that

16:45 - you can push back on other players a

16:47 - little bit more you don't have to have

16:50 - as much of a like yeah but we still got

16:52 - to be an adventuring party and we still

16:53 - have to go forward and all have to be

16:56 - friends at the end like

16:58 - there is something that is forcing us to

17:00 - be together

17:02 - and that is that we own this territory

17:04 - and that we

17:05 - have

17:06 - a hard time surviving without each other

17:09 - yeah so because that pushes us together

17:11 - we can like

17:13 - resist a little bit more and play a

17:15 - little bit more of a dynamic character

17:18 - because we have that yeah you know

17:20 - elasticity you don't have to justify

17:22 - emotionally while you're together it's

17:23 - an outside force exactly so you just

17:25 - hate each other

17:26 - yeah i mean we're growing to like each

17:28 - other i think we all

17:30 - start to respect each other

17:32 - uh you know two varying degrees yeah

17:35 - so i have a question for y'all's people

17:37 - not necessarily about these characters

17:39 - i'm gonna flip the script a bit okay so

17:42 - um i'm i'm gonna ask what if you could

17:45 - choose any clan

17:46 - to play a different character in this

17:47 - game would it be and joey for you it's

17:49 - if you were coming into this game with

17:51 - these characters as an npc

17:54 - what clan would you want to be to come

17:56 - in as and persephone if you were playing

17:58 - at the table as as a player what clan

18:00 - would you want to be

18:02 - your thoughts first

18:04 - i always want to play toriador i always

18:06 - always it's my instinct you tori adore

18:08 - them yeah um bruja though also interests

18:11 - me quite a bit yeah

18:15 - i think i'd come in as like a tech heavy

18:16 - nosferatu oh yeah why

18:19 - um

18:20 - partially because i feel like it might

18:22 - be what we're missing

18:23 - [Laughter]

18:24 - no but uh

18:26 - like have it rey is an interesting

18:30 - character to me but he's not necessarily

18:32 - something i normally play and normally

18:34 - gravitate towards like i kind of built
