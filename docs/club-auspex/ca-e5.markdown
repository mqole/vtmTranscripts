2:01 - is it just once a scene what's the those
2:03 - who can't
2:05 - paint kiss is what i always live by and
2:08 - those who paint do so when
2:11 - our lovely uh game master eloquently
2:13 - described an object so i was like well i
2:15 - gotta
2:16 - i gotta spray that now so when an object
2:19 - gets special description or when npc
2:21 - gets special descriptions yes they get
2:23 - either tagged or kissed anything jason
2:25 - carl talks about for more than 30
2:27 - seconds is getting something
2:31 - i felt bad that sarah hadn't tagged too
2:33 - much so i was like i gotta get that
2:36 - going yeah yeah i was trying to trying
2:38 - to
2:39 - get back in that muscle reflex and and
2:41 - now you've got it you have a slogan
2:43 - right we suck
2:47 - but we just cut it that
2:55 - it wasn't it wasn't meant to be
2:56 - foreshadowing oops but maybe it is yeah
3:02 - that would be playful but we got a
3:04 - problem oops
3:06 - i think we did a great job
3:08 - and i have no regrets
3:10 - at all
3:12 - you know things things have mistakes
3:14 - with me
3:16 - that
3:17 - i think everyone went into
3:21 - that parking garage cave with a
3:23 - different idea of how it was going to go
3:26 - i didn't expect a gun and no one was
3:28 - right shot in the head of a security
3:30 - guard no one's more surprised about that
3:33 - than your girls yeah girl i get it i get
3:35 - it we'll we'll get into that we'll get
3:37 - into that
3:39 - that's it
3:40 - we should probably talk about it
3:42 - we'll talk about what happened there
3:45 - um but
3:46 - before we do i just have to ask so you
3:49 - do kiss a lot of people i do a lot of
3:51 - other people
3:52 - is there any is there anyone
3:54 - special or is it all just
3:57 - open flirts uh it's an open invitation
4:02 - no i think uh the actual like answer is
4:05 - that uh yeah in this sort of unlike
4:07 - fuego
4:08 - is so desperate for connection
4:11 - and like affirmation and like the
4:13 - comfort that comes with like being
4:15 - accepted in those intimate moments like
4:18 - that is why she's acting out it's kind
4:19 - of why i built her to be a siren and
4:21 - still like reach back for that like
4:23 - strong physical connection there was
4:25 - even a moment in episode one uh where
4:27 - fuego like spoke up and then kind of
4:30 - quieted herself when she realized that
4:32 - this was like the click and she wanted
4:33 - to like
4:34 - verbally affirm like oh are we all going
4:36 - to stay together after all of this
4:37 - happens and kind of walked it back and i
4:40 - think not in a way where i want to make
4:42 - her too much of a sad sack but like
4:44 - this is a
4:45 - world of darkness and isolation and
4:48 - everything we've been seeing has
4:49 - affirmed that and i think it makes her a
4:51 - little more
4:53 - risky in her reaching for other people
4:55 - and trying to keep them close
4:57 - and
4:58 - uh
4:59 - she's she's got some inner codery
5:02 - flirtations happening as well is are we
5:04 - gonna is rego gonna be a thing
5:07 - oh my god
5:19 - i
5:20 - think it's very interesting that like
5:23 - there is obviously attraction there and
5:26 - like a sort of like beginnings of
5:28 - understanding but all of it is polluted
5:30 - with that like
5:31 - what part of this is your power and what
5:33 - part of this is just the moment and i i
5:37 - i'm so excited to see how we start to
5:39 - like move through that if we do
5:41 - and if we don't but she's
5:43 - she's reaching in the same way that she
5:45 - reaches for people
5:47 - and that's where she's at right now i
5:48 - ship it personally
5:51 - look he's gonna come in with those dope
5:53 - suits i mean what am i
5:56 - i'm not what are we supposed to do yeah
5:57 - that's not on me you're only human i'm
5:59 - only well she's i mean she's a little
6:01 - more than human
6:01 - [Music]
6:02 - oh that's true you're only i'm only
6:04 - kindred
6:06 - what can i do in the face of a good suit
6:08 - [Laughter]
6:10 - we've seen that not ty whoa
6:13 - have you seen that little little boop oh
6:15 - my god i get a very close view of the
6:17 - boop and it's great it's glorious it's
6:19 - so good
6:20 - the ray boop that's that's a thing
6:23 - so uh
6:24 - have you all have y'all worked together
6:26 - before been on show at all we literally
6:28 - met
6:29 - we literally met like a week ago yeah
6:32 - and
6:33 - we're we're hugging in the parking lot
6:35 - we're just like
6:36 - we're friends forever yes yes i feel
6:38 - like as your characters are getting to
6:40 - know each other y'all are getting to
6:41 - know each other off stage as well so
6:44 - there's a friendship building does that
6:45 - help your table rapport oh yeah i mean
6:49 - i'm very fortunate also to share a
6:50 - dressing room with abria so we get to
6:52 - talk a little bit about things that
6:55 - we want to try or things that we're
6:57 - hoping will happen or just how we're
6:58 - feeling about everything so that's been
7:00 - really helpful also she's just got so
7:01 - much experience i feel like i'm
7:03 - literally sharing a dressing room with
7:04 - yoda so except you have you're such a
7:06 - good just inherent storyteller and
7:08 - writer and all of it comes out in these
7:10 - like incredibly thoughtful moments so uh
7:13 - it's never me giving me advice i'm just
7:14 - like yes that more
7:16 - perfect i'm gonna die
7:19 - and then screaming about how cool all of
7:21 - her wardrobes oh my god how much i want
7:22 - to genuinely wear everything i think her
7:24 - wardrobe i love this i ship this yeah
7:26 - yeah yeah
7:28 - it's a friendship friendship friendship
7:30 - parade free red ships and blue ships but
7:32 - there's no ships like friendship
7:35 - right isn't that the i think so i don't
7:36 - know what it was but it was so good i'm
7:38 - just here to pull things out of my head
7:39 - i feel like you're doing a great job
7:44 - amazing um i do want to talk about you
7:47 - mentioned a little bit about fuego
7:48 - feeling her power there's also a little
7:50 - bit going on um with you and your
7:53 - character feeling freedom trying to find
7:55 - that yeah i think both it seems to me
7:58 - anyway but you know correct me if i'm
8:00 - wrong i feel like both of your
8:01 - characters are in a place where they're
8:02 - trying to
8:03 - figure themselves out they're dealing
8:05 - with their beast they're dealing with
8:07 - being kindred they're dealing with
8:08 - finding their place you know in a world
8:11 - that was very much theirs before but now
8:13 - they're a very different
8:14 - being
8:15 - so um i would love to hear a little bit
8:17 - about how y'all have decided to let your
8:20 - characters explore
8:21 - finding themselves
8:23 - please
8:24 - god thank you um oh my god uh i haven't
8:27 - had the door held open for me that's
8:29 - where i just can't i don't know too um
8:31 - serif is sarah
8:34 - she she really enjoyed a sort of
8:37 - laissez-faire situation before getting
8:39 - involved in all this so i think that
8:42 - being a kindred to her
8:43 - was just you know the challenges of
8:45 - dealing with the beast and and just
8:48 - being a little rebellious
8:50 - essentially a child like she was she was
8:52 - out running around not really being
8:54 - beholden to anybody and now she's coming
8:57 - to grips with a lot of responsibility
8:59 - that i don't think she's really ready
9:01 - for
9:02 - and that she is
9:04 - bitterly ill-equipped to handle um and i
9:08 - think that that is causing a lot of
9:10 - conflict she doesn't know
9:12 - what she should say she doesn't know
9:15 - what she
9:16 - should do and every time she tries what
9:19 - she thinks is the right thing to do
9:21 - she's either again bitterly ill-equipped
9:23 - to handle the situation from an
9:24 - attributes perspective or the rest of
9:27 - the codery for very justifiable reasons
9:30 - tells her you really shouldn't do that
9:32 - um so i i think serif is at a point
9:35 - right now where um
9:37 - kind of like the kid the kid who keeps
9:39 - getting kind of like a hit with a ruler
9:41 - she's i think she's getting really close
9:44 - to
9:44 - her breaking point of of everybody
9:47 - telling me what i can and can't do which
9:48 - is the whole thing that she
9:50 - didn't have to deal with for the last
9:52 - couple years yeah and you've also you
9:54 - had some moments with ray in this
9:55 - episode he was telling you
9:58 - basically how to feel about yourself
10:00 - yeah yeah
10:01 - and that was complicated and um i think
10:05 - that she
10:07 - she's only had a couple moments with rey
10:08 - and i think in the beginning there was
10:10 - this intrigue of like he seems very wise
10:12 - and he seems like he wants to
10:15 - be sort of a
10:16 - big brother or something to her and then
10:19 - as he has in my mind overstepped a
10:22 - little bit and is perhaps a bit too
10:24 - familiar considering he has a lot of his
10:25 - own issues to deal with
10:27 - um i think that her feelings about rey
10:29 - have become extremely conflicted throw
10:32 - the whole gang girl
10:33 - [Laughter]
10:36 - oh man
10:37 - yeah
10:38 - yeah oh my god oh thank you it's just a
10:40 - door that turtle turtle circle that's
10:42 - very good is it just going through
10:44 - yeah
10:46 - i think very similar similarly to that
10:49 - uh
10:50 - fuego's
10:51 - like life was so defined by community
10:55 - and i think she had finally found her
10:56 - stride
10:57 - when she was embraced she's like oh i'm
10:59 - a community organizer i care about local
11:01 - politics
11:02 - i'm going to live the values i was
11:03 - raised in and that's caring about other
11:05 - people and trusting other people
11:07 - and to have your
11:09 - priorities so violently readjusted by
11:13 - the fact of becoming kindred where you
11:15 - can't trust other people like the lesson
11:18 - we keep getting over and over is like
11:20 - question everything you have to find
11:21 - like your way in the world don't trust
11:24 - other people don't fall into like
11:26 - systems and authorities and it's like
11:27 - it's very much like the anarch
11:29 - understanding of the world and that's
11:31 - what we're living through and i think
11:33 - it's just anathema to like how fuego
11:36 - understands everything around her and
11:38 - it's just not going
11:40 - great tbh and even though her power set
11:44 - is so much about like i can kind of
11:46 - bring people in and like like hold them
11:48 - to me and kind of
11:49 - use my influence and ability to get the
11:51 - best out of other people
11:53 - none of that is real i think she's kind
11:55 - of bumping up against that
11:57 - and feeling more alone than ever despite
12:00 - finally having like a coterie i've
12:02 - totally i think that yeah it's like in a
12:04 - weird way now that we have more kindred
12:06 - it's
12:07 - more complicated yeah as when we were on
12:09 - our own that's so wild yeah yeah and
12:12 - both of your characters are getting
12:13 - pretty reckless
12:16 - you got pretty pretty your word and the
12:18 - word i think anyone that watched the
12:20 - episode might use
12:22 - yeah i mean we got we got a lot of
12:23 - hunger going on here yeah
12:26 - someone's look at this someone's thirsty
12:29 - [Laughter]
12:32 - god you rolled all three and it was
12:34 - great
12:35 - i thought it would be i thought it would
12:36 - just be a time saver
12:39 - to roll all three days oh man and in a
12:41 - way it was it truly was
12:43 - oh god yeah
12:45 - i almost wish i'd gone into the the
12:48 - parking garage with the hunger but i
12:50 - just don't i just don't know how that
12:53 - would have gone with everything else
12:54 - happening what's the worst that could
12:56 - happen oh i mean what happened
12:58 - couldn't could have gone worse but
13:01 - i think it was a love elegant solution
13:04 - to a problem that we made
13:07 - let's let's talk about let's talk about
13:09 - it oh gosh okay all right so
13:12 - yeah so fuego um
13:15 - did did something
13:17 - did a thing what so
13:19 - let's let's go to that moment real quick
13:20 - and and what is what's going through
13:22 - fuego's mind
13:24 - that she would do something that
13:26 - drastic oh
13:28 - uh i think it was interesting
13:30 - because uh
13:31 - at sort of at the table at the time
13:34 - there was that understanding that like
13:35 - she was standing with isaac who could
13:38 - see everything who has a similar skill
13:40 - set to her to like intervene and
13:42 - influence people and it's easy and just
13:45 - so doable
13:46 - but and of course that was my primary
13:49 - like just get in there make eye contact
13:51 - you can power the whole thing down it'll
13:53 - be fine
13:54 - and then realizing that like in that
13:56 - moment everything that we were talking
13:57 - about like the isolation
13:59 - and on top of that fuego's frustration
14:02 - with how every other fight has gone
14:05 - she's frozen in the moment of conflict
14:08 - uh when we were fighting
14:10 - uh the the bad boy that got away god she
14:13 - there was nothing that she could do to
14:15 - help and she felt herself like
14:17 - bumping on people's unswayable minds all
14:20 - the time so she doesn't even feel that
14:21 - effective with her skill set she feels
14:24 - underpowered and undervalued and in that
14:26 - moment
14:28 - she had the chance to grab and do
14:30 - something powerful and meaningful and
14:33 - finish it in one
14:34 - and
14:35 - it was just so easy to have that in a
14:38 - heartbeat
14:39 - you don't think about
14:41 - who that like pillar of personality what
14:43 - you think you care about and she was
14:45 - willing to risk it all to just feel that
14:48 - moment of power and satisfaction and
14:50 - finality
14:52 - which i think she doesn't get with her
14:53 - like very messy very social skill set
14:56 - yeah and it is i mean you could say it's
14:59 - a very vin true thing to do to use that
15:01 - particular power yeah uh to convince
15:04 - someone to let you shoot them with their
15:06 - own gun yeah um
15:09 - but
15:10 - as a player
15:12 - how do you feel this is gonna affect
15:14 - you know uh if we go going forward
15:16 - because that's i mean that's gotta leave
15:17 - a stain right oh yeah she's
15:20 - absolutely wrecked by it and
15:24 - i think it's colored a lot of uh
15:26 - the rest of the episode her bumping
15:29 - against isaac
15:31 - because you really like there wasn't a
15:33 - lot of data for her to like angrily
15:35 - react to i think it's more she
15:38 - understands that he has all of the like
15:40 - cool composure and the long vision and
15:43 - enough context to make the right choices
15:46 - and she just feels messy and wrong and i
15:48 - think that's going to like sort of turn
15:50 - and burn inside her inside of her for a
15:52 - while because once she gets back and you
15:55 - have those moments to breathe and
15:57 - reevaluate who you are against what
15:59 - you've done
16:00 - it doesn't add up anymore and she's
16:02 - going to start moving through that and
16:05 - decide what part of her is the person
16:07 - she is now and what that means for who
16:09 - she thought she would always be yeah
16:13 - yeah
16:14 - yeah
16:15 - as heavy as it is for you to hear it
16:18 - imagine us having to live
16:20 - it well that's why we're here yeah yeah
16:24 - we can ask you what it was like oh my
16:26 - god what i mean what was what were you
16:28 - thinking when this was happening
16:29 - oh boy i was
16:32 - i was very surprised and uh immediately
16:35 - like well what are we gonna do about
16:37 - this
16:38 - and the frustration of then having rey
16:41 - do something that i was not expecting
16:44 - somebody who again
16:46 - was trying to be somebody who i thought
16:48 - could be a good influence or be a good
16:52 - example for me
16:53 - doing a convenient thing at the time for
16:56 - his conscience
16:57 - but comes up against a lot of
16:59 - frustrations that sarah has with with
17:01 - ghouls and how they're utilized because
17:03 - her mom is a ghoul
17:05 - and uh
17:06 - yeah
17:07 - and that is something that is
17:09 - uh
17:11 - extremely morally conflicting for her
17:13 - yeah she had half of your codery just
17:15 - just being and i'm not a big fan of
17:17 - isaac right now either so
17:20 - throw the whole
17:22 - tea away i think sheriff's really going
17:24 - through a thing right now i think she
17:26 - just feels like she doesn't know where
17:27 - she fits in and
17:29 - she doesn't know
17:31 - who to turn to in this moment and i
17:33 - think bree provided some
17:36 - interesting wisdom about the rejection
17:38 - of mentorship the rejection of
17:41 - following uh you know a code or a path
17:45 - and just following instead of freedom
17:47 - which is what i think serif ultimately
17:49 - does desire
17:51 - yeah yeah brie of course brie
17:54 - added a lot of
17:55 - words of wisdom for you and then just
17:57 - another makeup buddy is that uh no i
18:00 - mean
18:01 - yes because i'm sorry did you see bree
18:03 - uh but no it was absolutely the same
18:06 - thing she came in with this energy that
18:08 - was like hey
18:09 - whatever choice you made it's the choice
18:11 - you made and you have to stand by it and
18:12 - i think that sort of even if it's just a
18:15 - balm for a moment
18:17 - it's enough to get you out of the like
18:19 - hey if i keep thinking about this i'm
18:21 - gonna spiral and never come out and
18:23 - having someone that was just like hey
18:25 - you made a choice and own it and we are
18:27 - people that simply do and like it was
18:30 - just all the things she needed to hear
18:33 - in that moment i think she was just sort
18:35 - of overcome with like it was gratitude
18:38 - and attraction
18:39 - and relief and release and pushing off
18:42 - uh via
18:44 - you know sexual energy like
18:47 - i'm happy to move to a different part of
18:49 - my body because if i stay in my brain
18:50 - it's gonna be bad yeah so i think there
18:52 - was just a lot of like relief
18:55 - in that moment it was nice to meet a
18:56 - playful kindred as well yes uh like ooh
18:59 - somebody just downed a clown yes right
19:02 - she's got a cool bird yeah i liked the
19:04 - bird
19:05 - [Laughter]
19:06 - but we talked a lot about what y'all
19:07 - were thinking during the episode uh i
19:09 - just want to close with because you
19:11 - obviously you both embody your
19:12 - characters and and make very uh
19:15 - reactionary decisions that are very uh
19:18 - steeped in in character choices i'd love
19:21 - to know how you get in character before
19:22 - i know you've got a playlist right yes
19:24 - do you do you listen to music i too have
19:26 - a playlist yes sir okay so
19:29 - yeah so how do you guys get in character
19:31 - before each show you jammed your
19:33 - playlist what's the how does music help
19:35 - help you get to this place um it's a lot
19:38 - of desperado by rihanna and uh
19:42 - so just the the idea that there's like a
19:44 - sound statement also fun by vince
19:45 - staples so now we have to share these
19:47 - these are
19:48 - it's out there it's out there um i'll
19:51 - share it somewhere for people to listen
19:53 - to but um just having a soundscape of
19:57 - you know a feeling that you can't
19:59 - necessarily easily access like my real
20:01 - life is nothing like this so
20:03 - finding
20:04 - a mood that can help me access those
20:07 - emotions and then just trying to stay in
20:09 - it picking picking sarah's outfit for
20:11 - the day also helps a lot um i think she
20:14 - does have a little bit of a
20:16 - costume story if i if i have my silly
20:20 - little brain about it of like okay these
20:21 - are
20:22 - these are the the things that i think
20:24 - she's grappling with and i try to help
20:26 - the wardrobe support that
20:28 - yeah so those help me a lot thanks
20:31 - uh a lot of that and then uh personally
20:34 - uh
20:36 - i play a lot of rpgs so i
20:39 - and i lean a lot of my on my memory to
20:41 - like i think i keep a pretty good
20:44 - tight ship of like what's going on but i
20:46 - really like waking up the morning uh of
20:49 - like the game and writing down the first
20:52 - three things i remember from the
20:54 - previous episode and it like if you
20:56 - think hard enough like i don't remember
20:57 - the whole episode but like what are the
20:58 - first three things that pop up there's
21:00 - an emotional like there's something
21:02 - emotional tied to the character tied to
21:04 - that and using that as like a little bit
21:06 - of a guidepost for it like these are
21:08 - going to be fuego's priorities the
21:10 - things that are still sort of on her
21:11 - mind
21:12 - going into the next day and having those
21:15 - and then i have a long like fuego
21:17 - playlist
21:18 - and i tend to skip around to the tracks
21:20 - that i think like
21:22 - i'm trying to build pathways to like
21:24 - okay she's thinking about this and i'll
21:26 - try to like tether it to a specific song
21:28 - and then just listen that song
21:31 - over and over and over in the car like a
21:33 - crazy person
21:34 - and just really like dig in on the like
