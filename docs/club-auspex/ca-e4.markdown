0:44 - to vampire oh hello uh well i'm shane
0:47 - easton and i was in l.a by night
0:49 - actually and i had a lot of great scenes
0:51 - with this guy
0:52 - in l.a by night we didn't like each
0:54 - other we didn't like each other yeah we
0:56 - like each other okay and really in real
0:58 - life that's fine in real life it's we
1:00 - tolerate each other we had a lot of
1:01 - acting in the in the you know
1:04 - just like in l.a by night
1:06 - sure
1:08 - well that is interesting we have talked
1:10 - with alex about uh the difference
1:12 - between playing jasper versus playing
1:14 - isaac i'd love to know the difference
1:17 - being at the table with each other with
1:18 - these new characters and being uh you
1:21 - know maybe
1:22 - i'll say slightly less you know uh oil
1:25 - and water i know you did you did um
1:29 - you know make some interesting choices
1:31 - when you all met today always make
1:32 - interesting choices yeah
1:34 - um
1:35 - yeah it's it's it's really fun i love
1:38 - playing with the same person as a
1:41 - different character because it opens up
1:42 - a whole new
1:43 - world of
1:45 - choices and different reactions and
1:46 - things like that and jasper and katya
1:48 - were very much at odds
1:50 - um all pretty much all the time and uh
1:52 - so it was nice to other than
1:55 - trying to impose my will on somebody um
1:58 - it was nice to have just kind of a
2:00 - less
2:01 - hostile relationship absolutely
2:04 - and and my character um had met them
2:07 - before through jason a storyteller but
2:09 - today i was meeting everybody for the
2:12 - first time which was really fun so it
2:13 - was really cool to be able to look
2:16 - across the table alex and go i don't
2:18 - hate you at all
2:20 - i might i don't know eventually
2:23 - everyone will eventually um
2:25 - and also like
2:27 - we we're good at like i feel like
2:29 - playing with alex and a lot of people
2:31 - that i played with in aliba night it's
2:32 - like fun to come back as different
2:33 - characters because
2:36 - i feel like there's kind of this
2:37 - undercurrent of we know how to
2:39 - how to play tennis with each other in
2:41 - this game we know we know how to do the
2:43 - back and forth and how to how to move it
2:45 - forward and um
2:47 - push each other's buttons it's really
2:49 - fun yeah no i love it was there a
2:51 - different sort of energy at this table
2:53 - with with this
2:54 - this country versus l.a
2:57 - yeah absolutely i think right yeah
3:01 - yeah there was a the the there was it's
3:04 - difficult to judge
3:06 - what i don't remember what la by night
3:07 - season one was versus what this season
3:11 - one is
3:12 - i remember what season five of l.a
3:13 - benedict season four was but there was
3:15 - so much we had built up and so much
3:16 - emotions packed into that show it was it
3:19 - was so tense all the time and now this
3:22 - is so different and so it's it seems
3:24 - very different but i'm sure at la night
3:26 - season one in this season when we're not
3:27 - as different as they appear to me now if
3:29 - that makes any sense that is true you're
3:31 - coming on as an npc without any baggage
3:34 - uh well i'm sure all vampires have
3:36 - packaged but oh there's plenty but but
3:39 - not any interpersonal baggage where
3:40 - you're just it's entirely new it's fresh
3:43 - you get to sort of build new
3:44 - relationships with with these kindred
3:47 - fun um it's like a blank blank slate
3:50 - um some other fun stuff happened in
3:53 - with your character alex today in the
3:55 - episode uh in that isaac sort of let
3:58 - serif redecorate his home yeah and we've
4:01 - we've gotten a little glimpse of how
4:03 - maybe important possessions are
4:06 - to isaac just maybe just a little bit so
4:09 - how do you feel isaac felt about
4:11 - somebody else
4:13 - well um
4:16 - he's not necessarily
4:18 - gung-ho about it
4:20 - but he has
4:22 - ideas and
4:24 - in his i'm
4:25 - in order to not give away anything i
4:27 - might be trying to do
4:28 - he has ideas and
4:32 - allowing this to happen is a means to an
4:34 - end for him
4:36 - okay i i think i see where that's going
4:39 - that makes sense
4:41 - um
4:43 - you know that that's interesting that
4:44 - kind of brings up not only in character
4:48 - making decisions and holding back what
4:50 - you're really thinking or what you're
4:51 - really feeling etc but also as players i
4:55 - think both of y'all are navigating some
4:57 - interesting decisions
4:59 - in that uh alex you've kind of become
5:02 - almost like a
5:03 - lore keeper or like a wikipedia for the
5:06 - for the baby vamps at the table um and
5:10 - so every time there's something new it's
5:12 - like um isaac what is this but
5:15 - how much
5:16 - are you holding back of what you
5:18 - actually know like how do you
5:20 - oh how do i like gauge what to say what
5:23 - yeah yeah um
5:26 - i'm trying to do it in such a way that
5:27 - doesn't seem like
5:30 - player knowledge because i haven't i
5:32 - have a history with the world of
5:33 - darkness and i know a lot of things
5:35 - um but the way i'm kind of looking at it
5:37 - is isaac is
5:40 - has been told some things by his sire
5:42 - but also has figured some things out
5:43 - because he is
5:45 - while not so good at the interpersonal
5:47 - relationships he's very observant
5:49 - and watches a lot of things and
5:51 - is a sponge for knowledge in that kind
5:53 - of way so he's just picked up some stuff
5:56 - whether or not it's fully accurate
5:58 - he doesn't know or
6:00 - he could be lying yeah so i just try and
6:03 - take
6:04 - the most surface level
6:06 - thoughts on certain things from the
6:08 - world of darkness and give those and i
6:09 - don't try and delve too deeply into
6:11 - certain things other than like my own
6:14 - personal observations of what like
6:16 - oh i met this person they were a venture
6:18 - i noticed this personality trait about
6:20 - that person that applies to all vendrew
6:23 - yeah all right so he's he's very yeah
6:26 - puts people in boxes people in
6:28 - spreadsheets yes
6:31 - and similarly sheen
6:33 - um so you got to sort of sink your teeth
6:35 - into a hakata which is very fun
6:40 - i was
6:41 - i was a little um interested in treat uh
6:43 - your sort of interpretation of their uh
6:48 - looks like fascination with death and um
6:51 - i'd love to hear about how you kind of
6:52 - navigated that and were you
6:55 - what you decided would how you'd project
6:57 - that out and like what did you know
6:59 - before what did you discover at the
7:01 - table oh man
7:03 - that's tough i mean i think for this
7:06 - character
7:07 - cat
7:08 - in a way
7:10 - death is really what
7:12 - gets her off can i say that yes okay yes
7:16 - [Laughter]
7:18 - yeah i think that it's the thing that
7:19 - just really gets her off and turns her
7:21 - on and and she's just
7:22 - so
7:23 - so into it and i and i think that
7:26 - that became enhanced when she was
7:28 - embraced but i also think as a
7:32 - mortal
7:33 - i think that was
7:35 - you know fascinating to her as well i
7:38 - think that she was a girl who was into
7:41 - the macabre
7:42 - and that scene and so
7:44 - and part of it could have been just
7:45 - because her family
7:47 - uh has this history and it just kind of
7:50 - seeped into her and then also the the
7:52 - subcultures that she was into around the
7:53 - time that she was embraced
7:57 - so yeah that was basically
7:59 - and and then playing with them
8:02 - it was fun because i was really able to
8:05 - to to play with that like a like a cat
8:07 - with the ball of string i was i was
8:08 - looking for those
8:10 - those moments that would that would get
8:12 - cat a little excited and a little a
8:14 - little happy
8:15 - happy happy
8:18 - you know happy happiness
8:21 - you know
8:22 - yeah because i think we've uh
8:24 - we've established unlike unlike the club
8:26 - here our our main our main cast none of
8:29 - them have aspects no so i love that yeah
8:33 - so it was very much you know almost all
8:36 - of the things you had going on they had
8:37 - no idea yeah no none of us know anything
8:40 - we a lot of us have a lot of crossovers
8:42 - when it comes to power which is really
8:43 - interesting and it's
8:45 - it's become
8:47 - like having to gather information
8:49 - by just like looking in the phone book
8:51 - it's like not that phone books exist
8:53 - anymore but you get what i mean it's
8:55 - it's like tracy van persie yeah it's
8:57 - like well we got to find this thing well
8:58 - i guess let's go there and look
9:01 - we have no way to know
9:02 - unless we stumble into it which i kind
9:04 - of like it's it's really fun and it's
9:06 - caused us to get into trouble
9:08 - immediately
9:10 - you need a friend like cat really yeah
9:12 - yeah you do yeah um and isaac has zero
9:14 - problem with it
9:16 - uh
9:17 - yeah
9:18 - how
9:19 - how does isaac feel about the coterie
9:22 - this is now four episodes in
9:24 - we talked about how
9:25 - you alex discovered a lot of isaac at
9:27 - the table now that we've gotten to know
9:29 - or you've gotten to know alex or got to
9:31 - know isaac a bit more
9:33 - you may have gotten to know yourself a
9:34 - bit more who knows oh every day um
9:36 - has isaac gotten to know
9:38 - more about this codery and changed his
9:40 - mind at all about them no he's very um
9:47 - over the there's been a couple like a
9:48 - couple days time jump in between a few
9:50 - of the episodes and he spent those days
9:52 - kind of observing like when when serif
9:55 - is decorating when she's painting when
9:57 - doing the thing
9:58 - uh he's just watched and seen how
10:02 - she deals with that how he's just
10:04 - been observing every single person of
10:05 - the country to try and in his way
10:07 - understand who they are and what they
10:09 - what they want and what they're trying
10:10 - to find and all these things
10:13 - whether or not he understands why or
10:14 - what the motivation is
10:16 - but he
10:18 - is dealing with him that way and he he
10:20 - also feels
10:22 - his role that has been kind of thrust
10:24 - upon him because he is in fact the
10:26 - oldest by very little years um
10:29 - is to kind of show them what
10:31 - they're supposed to be doing in this
10:32 - world to or at least when they have a
10:34 - question inform them so he's kind of
10:36 - just around
10:38 - in case something comes up
10:41 - uh he doesn't have a lot of he has his
10:43 - own personal things he wants to do um
10:46 - that have that still exist even though
10:49 - we've kind of been put on this path
10:51 - um but they haven't yet coincided with
10:54 - what the coterie is trying to do so he's
10:56 - still doing those things
10:57 - so in nights where they've been a part
10:59 - he's been doing his own thing and
11:01 - working still is still is has his own
11:04 - personal life but um
11:05 - i'm sure we'll get into that at some
11:06 - point
11:10 - um
11:11 - and
11:12 - with your character and your character
11:14 - creation
11:15 - uh so we've seen this character before
11:18 - uh as you said she was introduced very
11:20 - briefly by jason but at that point you
11:23 - had already
11:24 - created the character so jason was
11:25 - referring to the character you created
11:26 - you got to like build
11:29 - cat right yes
11:31 - jason and i talked about it together uh
11:33 - and i
11:35 - i didn't want her to be you know we all
11:38 - have these kind of ideas like i wanted
11:40 - her to be an on-the-nose hikata so
11:42 - obsessed with death in the mortuary
11:44 - whatever but i also wanted to give her
11:46 - her own
11:47 - flavor and style
11:50 - and so we talked about it and this is
11:52 - who we came up with and
11:54 - yeah she's a little weird and sad
11:58 - it was a good description while like i
12:00 - always find that in in rpgs there is a
12:04 - there's fun in stereotypes
12:06 - while not necessarily in real life
12:09 - um
12:10 - types can be harmful most of the time
12:12 - but in rpgs
12:14 - taking a stereotype or like you know
12:16 - whether it be world of darkness or
12:18 - another
12:19 - role-playing game taking the stereotype
12:20 - of a clan saiyan vampire and then
12:23 - being like okay i like the stereotype
12:24 - but then let's
12:26 - build some stuff around it let's put
12:28 - some holes in it let's change some
12:29 - things and that's always really i like
12:31 - making characters that way where i take
12:32 - the there is the thing that they're
12:34 - known for but
12:36 - yeah they also like
12:37 - pachinko machines
12:39 - so taking the stereotype and then sort
12:41 - of giving it depth yeah and making it
12:43 - more than just the stereotype the
12:45 - stereotype yeah but the stereotype is
12:46 - still true but but yeah pachenko
12:49 - machines oh yes
12:50 - why that's the first thing i thought of
12:52 - that's what every rpg character like
12:54 - that's on their list of
12:57 - likes and dislikes it's the need of rpg
12:59 - characters
13:02 - you know i just i've lost
13:07 - i've just realized i've ruined our whole
13:09 - black and white vibe by wearing this
13:10 - green shirt i we
13:12 - we put it all in what you do how are you
13:14 - doing
13:16 - you come here territory
13:19 - what are we talking about what are the
13:20 - questions
13:23 - um
13:24 - do you find a lot of your character at
13:25 - the table like alex does or do do you
13:27 - prepare more and come knowing who that
13:29 - person is
13:30 - both i think i mean i think i prepare as
13:33 - much as i as i can
13:35 - honestly i love because i love doing
13:37 - that work like i love researching and
13:40 - thinking about outfits and thinking
13:41 - about the family history and this and
13:44 - that and stuff but then when you sit at
13:46 - the table
13:47 - and you have to be able to let
13:49 - everything kind of go and leave room for
13:52 - possibility and then when those
13:53 - possibilities come up you're
13:56 - you're you're prepared for it and you
13:57 - have the most fun that way i think when
13:59 - you leave room for possibility okay i
14:01 - have a question for both of you and that
14:03 - in that vein
14:05 - not necessarily with these characters
14:07 - not necessarily with vampire but
14:09 - has
14:10 - has ever been a moment at the table
14:12 - where you learn something about your
14:13 - character that you that surprised you
14:16 - like your character's reaction to
14:18 - somebody else saying something or
14:19 - something you
14:20 - you didn't anticipate coming out just in
14:22 - general as far as like playing rpgs as
14:25 - characters and
14:26 - yeah
14:28 - yeah i've i've had there were definitely
14:30 - reactions with jasper that like i didn't
14:32 - expect and things i didn't expect to do
14:34 - like ideas that came into my head in the
14:36 - moment that i just went oh we're gonna
14:37 - do that case in point uh starting the
14:40 - whole chloe debacle at the end of season
14:42 - one by writing a note and then being
14:44 - like oh right people can recognize
14:46 - handwriting and that became a story for
14:49 - five seasons it was just but that was
14:51 - that was i had no intention of doing
14:53 - that my full intention in going into
14:54 - that episode was to sit there quietly
14:56 - the entire time and not say a word and
14:57 - then at the very end i was like i'm
14:59 - gonna do this
15:00 - and and then you drove chloe crazy yeah
15:02 - and then i drove chloe crazy amazing
15:04 - yeah i think for me too in
15:08 - using la by night as an example it was
15:10 - when katya met victor in his club and
15:13 - they had a scene together
15:15 - i
15:16 - i honestly went to that table really
15:18 - having no idea what we were going to
15:21 - talk about what we're going to do and it
15:22 - ended up being
15:23 - probably one of the most
15:25 - nuanced and emotional
15:27 - scenes for my character and it was just
15:30 - a real treat so
15:32 - i
15:33 - i learned a lot about katya in that
15:35 - scene and
15:37 - that's why i think everybody should just
15:38 - be open yeah like it's scary but it's a
15:41 - good kind of scary yeah it's part of the
15:43 - reason why i
15:45 - make jason's job harder by asking him to
15:47 - tell me very little is because i want to
15:49 - experience things and change my opinion
15:51 - and
15:52 - and he's very gracious and
15:56 - yeah doing that for me
15:58 - well i mean it clearly works you you
16:00 - know
16:01 - you both
16:02 - just have such a great ability to sort
16:04 - of
16:05 - just in
16:06 - capture roles but you're also both
16:09 - professional actors you do scripted
16:12 - stuff outside of this how does this
16:13 - compare to what you do
16:16 - in other projects
16:18 - it's a great
16:20 - exercise as well as being a game that we
16:23 - love i think because i i feel like i'm
16:25 - always learning
16:27 - um
16:27 - i'm always learning things at the table
16:30 - for what i do on stage and also vice
16:33 - versa sometimes i'm doing something on
16:35 - stage and i'm like you know what if i
16:36 - what would it look like if i tried to do
16:38 - that at the table um so
16:41 - it's
16:42 - it's both you don't need to be a
16:44 - professional actor to do this you can
16:45 - just be anybody having fun and that's
16:47 - the beauty of it but i mean there are
16:48 - things that are fun to play with and
16:50 - that we can learn from
16:52 - yeah no there's very much the same
16:53 - reason that's how it feels for me i i
16:55 - really like
16:56 - part so much of what i do
16:58 - especially working mainly in film i
16:59 - don't do it's been a long time since
17:01 - i've worked on a stage um
17:05 - i so many people have input
17:07 - on my character so many people have
17:09 - ideas so many people are are higher up
17:11 - the food chain than i am with the
17:12 - decisions that the character makes
17:14 - which is fine i don't need but in
17:17 - at this table
17:19 - there's two people
17:20 - who decide what happens to this
17:21 - character is myself and it is jason and
17:23 - there's a
17:25 - so much freedom in that of go as of just
17:27 - i can just say things and they happen
17:30 - and i can just make a decision whether
17:31 - it's good or bad become a sheriff yes
17:33 - become sheriff or say no and then kind
17:36 - of say yes and then no again
17:38 - um
17:39 - just you just
17:40 - i you make a decision whether it's good
17:42 - or bad and you stick with it and you
17:43 - just commit to the decision you made and
17:45 - then you know if i if i really up
17:47 - jason will come to me after the episode
17:49 - go we're going to change that a little
17:50 - bit we'll be away from that which
17:52 - thankfully hasn't really happened so
17:54 - um but yeah that's my favorite thing
17:56 - about it is just that that that
17:58 - in working in an industry where i rarely
18:00 - get much control over what i do
18:02 - to then have
18:04 - to be able to create a character all on
18:05 - my own and bayla and think of every
18:07 - aspect of it yeah
18:09 - yeah
