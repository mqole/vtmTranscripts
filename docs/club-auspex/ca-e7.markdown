0:02 - [Music]

0:10 - hi i'm ash minik and this is club ospecs this is the show where we chat with the

0:16 - players from new york by night and kind of you know go inside their heads and see the unseen as it were uh and talking

0:50 - uh the musical yeah cabaret is a big hit here at club

0:57 - a lot of pale people it's the vibe we're going for it tracks yeah it makes sense

1:02 - so today was a really interesting episode you split the party yeah all

1:08 - individually yeah yeah i didn't see yours i'm going to learn things i saw his yes because i was in the makeup

1:14 - chair and they were streaming it in there that was great and i was in makeup when you went yeah they didn't stream for me

1:21 - so apparently they like you better maybe maybe that's what it was that's what it was yeah i didn't look like that that's

1:27 - the problem when no that's the problem because i was here in the last campaign and now i'm the old guy and there's all

1:33 - these new people here and they like them better oh no i don't think that's it at all that's probably not

1:40 - anyway what are we doing we split the party yes that's right the party was that was that worrying at all

1:46 - were you guys were you excited um i'm i was so happy that alex got to

1:52 - go first because i because i was worried about going first um yeah i know i i

1:57 - liked it i think it's fun to you know break it up a little bit and then give everybody a chance to kind of

2:03 - explore little little narratives for themselves and develop and learn different things on their own um and

2:09 - then come back with that i think that's good character development yeah i am and i i we've we had done

2:15 - similar stuff like this on alibaba where we've had some little individual things and stuff like that so that was that was it was fun to get to do it with a new

2:21 - character yeah yeah man i didn't know if you knew this alex was on the show before i had heard

2:26 - whisperings of this yeah uh i don't know you look familiar yeah he does look different uh so i i

2:33 - wasn't sure

2:40 - um but you guys you both did get to explore your characters which was really fun um alex you did this but myanna both

2:48 - of y'all got a little beasty as it were oh didn't we we got a little you got a little little feisty we got

2:54 - oh my gosh of course well um so i went with my little thin blood friend that i

2:59 - befriended from the club yes man i should have killed my last game wait really you were trying to kill him

3:05 - no like i almost did in l.a by night oh it's all right because he's a return yeah oh well thank you almost killed him

3:12 - for not killing him yeah i'm glad then so that i could learn so lessons we did some blood alchemy we painted a really

3:19 - pretty sun with a bunch of bloody hands on it and and i think francis has a crush on

3:24 - me now and i don't know what to do with i don't know how to deal with that that's cool yeah

3:30 - i just wanted a friend isn't that how it always happens i know seraph has that effect on people

3:37 - that's true in general uh interacting with the beast what is what how does that feel because it's you

3:43 - know it's it is jason playing an npc sort of but it's very different than the other ones

3:48 - so how does that differ with how you um speak to that at the table i mean

3:55 - i've always interpreted the way that happens is that obviously yeah we talk about the beast inside but

4:00 - it's it's basically it's it's an internal monologue that you're having it's like it's like intrusive thoughts that come into your

4:06 - head that just there aren't yours they're just random these thoughts that come in and then the the talkback that

4:12 - happens all you know in interior it's not you know out loud no one hears that happen except

4:19 - for xander um oh who once answered my beast which was excellent um but only he can

4:25 - do that um but uh yeah it was um that i like that dynamic it's one of my favorite things about the game we play

4:31 - is that dynamic of the beast when because it's not in the rulebook it's just something that jason in his

4:38 - glorious experience of being a dm or a storyteller for us um is that he does this it's a cool little thing that just

4:44 - exists and uh it's one of my favorite things we do on the show what's canon now yeah yeah i mean i like the fact

4:50 - that it's something that gives you i i like anything that gives you additional like character flavor dynamics

4:56 - regardless of if it like drives the plot or not i think it's just something that's really engaging and as a player i

5:02 - just love hearing all of the different beast characterizations that exist because

5:07 - yeah it's just it's a very fun very immersive part of the experience and i want to know about other people's

5:12 - characters well that soon as a voice comes out i'm like who's that guy yeah who's that i want to know who that is yeah

5:18 - yeah it is fun and yours changes so that's even yeah which is really fun and i'm very much looking forward to when people understand why that happens yeah

5:25 - and you i mean you guys have now played uh seven sessions yes um i know this one you didn't necessarily play together but

5:31 - you've gone through almost an entire season you've got to see each other's characters grow and

5:36 - you know get to know each other as players as well as characters so i'm going to ask you sort of an opposite of

5:41 - the beast type question which is just some niceties i want to know i want i want you guys to look at look at each

5:47 - other in the eye and i want to know what you enjoy about the other person's character

5:53 - oh my god i'll go first oh my god i think isaac i think your your choices as an actor are

6:00 - just so impeccable like obviously like i see the craft i see like the specificity i see

6:06 - just i love the accent i love the styling i just think isaac is is just a fascinating person at any time he talks

6:13 - or anytime he does something i'm i'm as an as a player fascinated and i think serif is also equally fascinating

6:21 - uh i love serif as a concept in that it's

6:27 - you created you went how do i want to say this you went into this game creating something that is

6:32 - effectively immortal unless outside forces cause it to die and you went great

6:37 - that means it's fun forever as a character the character was like great we just get to have fun all the

6:42 - time at night yeah and you know coming from you as a tagger being awake at night going on in the middle of night you're

6:47 - you know it's like great i just my normal lifestyle keeps going and i get to have fun all the time and then immediately just slamming into the big

6:54 - wall that goes no that's not what happens that you don't get to have fun almost ever and so

6:59 - it's just it was such a heartbreaking core piece of this character that i loved so much oh my god that's such a

7:05 - great thing to bring into the game i remember yeah and just a different way to

7:10 - show innocence in a character than we've done before oh oh i'm so glad i remember like

7:15 - jason gave a description of the club and like us like living in this moment where like oh and it could last forever and i

7:21 - was like oh this is nice i hope it stays like this that's the whole show y'all clubbing

7:26 - that's awesome nice times yeah this is i think this is the first time in the history of the

7:32 - any of our vampire shows that we've gone to a club and most of the codery hasn't gone dancing

7:40 - at this time only one of us went dancing in any time we've gone to

7:45 - uh that place that i can't remember the name of it right now y'all can dance here no no okay

7:52 - mayana's into it um speaking of character creation and working with jason there was also some

7:58 - really interesting stuff um i so i would love if we could chat a little

8:04 - bit about the mechanics of leveling up y'all are leveling up as the season yes progresses and we don't do

8:10 - that on camera so yeah and but you find really interesting ways to make it part of the story

8:15 - um there was obviously a very big level up for isaac right in this episode so how did you all decide how that was

8:21 - going to happen well uh the the discipline that allows isaac to do that which is called vicissitude is something

8:26 - is really only really available generally speaking to the specific clan

8:32 - that isaac is and so it is something that i and this being my favorite clan i've always

8:38 - wanted to explore this i've never really gotten the chance so when i was coming up with isaac i was talking to

8:44 - jason um i very much wanted to among among the plethora of other ideas that

8:50 - didn't make it into isaac um there was this idea that i wanted it to manifest i didn't want to have it at

8:57 - the beginning i wanted it to be something that because the way i personally look at

9:03 - vampires in this world they develop the way their discipline is developing because of the way fifth edition has have these has this

9:10 - branching path for disciplines instead of just like level one level two level three like it used to have it feels to me more real if a kindred

9:18 - reacts to the situations that it encounters by developing disciplines in a certain

9:24 - way so it's it's the same thing i did with jasper in that like depending on what happens to the character that is how i

9:30 - follow the disciplines and how i explore as though the body is reacting to what is happening around it so i

9:37 - wanted it to manifest in a certain way when i was using my lower level powers to at one point in a

9:42 - very you know a tense situation or wherever jason deemed it to be right it would manifest in a certain way

9:49 - and that would allow me to then follow that path down yeah and i mean it's pretty fascinating i think it's one of the things i love about this show is

9:56 - that everything is so story based even though there is this whole layer of mechanics over it with the game it just

10:02 - comes out in character and i mean obviously alex is a veteran he's done this before but mayana being new to

10:10 - playing vampire uh in this way has how has that been for you being more um have

10:16 - you felt more like i want to say engross but i don't think that's the word i mean i definitely i

10:21 - mean i definitely feel engrossed or embraced but um

10:27 - yeah i i i watched a lot of the show you know especially after i'd been cast because i wanted to do research and

10:33 - stuff and i saw how how the players in that show you know integrated their different abilities and

10:39 - and you know and tried to keep things within the narrative like i think the the they describe it as like larp top so

10:46 - it's like there's a role play always being at the forefront of the experience which i think is really cool and and i

10:51 - like that as a thing so i always tried to figure out ways of like how do i reveal information how do i reveal

10:58 - ability that feels justified and would logically make sense for this this character that i'm playing

11:04 - of like she's not just gonna do every ability every time like she's not gonna

11:10 - just like be the most at every opportunity like there's there's different places yeah

11:16 - very much so it's like you have to slot in the different building blocks where it makes sense so i think being able to i mean i'm learning so

11:23 - much from all of the wonderful other other cast members as well like oh that was a really cool choice that they made them like how do i how do i learn from

11:30 - from them as well yeah yeah well before we wrap up and go to your your counterparts at the other tables

11:36 - which will also just be right here great magic um kept it warm for somebody see what are your

11:43 - let's let's project into the future what are your predictions for the finale where would you like to

11:50 - see these characters go do you have any personal goals that are maybe different than your character's goals

11:57 - answer everything i'll go first i think um i just i really want to see us come together as a codery i really want to

12:03 - feel like we get to a point where we you know see the value in each other and

12:09 - and their and their feels to be that camaraderie um i'd what

12:15 - i hoped a kid can dream um and then i i do want to see like

12:21 - and then just go hang in clubs and dance yeah i would love to go back to the club and dance and not have to do any more

12:26 - jobs or anything um i think i think i also i want to learn more about about isaac i i think isaac is the character

12:33 - who i think is still shrouded in the most mystery so any chance i get to to learn more about

12:38 - about him and it i i again i just find the character super fascinating so that's just like as a player i'm always

12:43 - like yes more more story yeah uh i also i mean also narratively speaking

12:48 - like or jasper woof uh isaac for reasons um for multiple reasons wants everybody to

12:54 - come back together um he has there's things they still need to do and he's done one of the jobs that we needed

12:59 - to do but he can't do all of them on his own so he desperately needs help from other people to complete these things but also um

13:08 - he i would like to see um let's see

13:14 - i would really like it if i'm more see i never plan ahead this is the thing like i i don't i i'm so

13:20 - excited to see what jason has in store for the last episode because it's the last episode of the season and

13:25 - something always happens and um so i i know i i mentioned it a

13:31 - couple a couple episodes ago i mentioned um getting them some more information trying to clear up any of the questions

13:36 - i had so hopefully we can get to that and um and get them some answers for things they need

13:42 - because isaac doesn't want to have to answer questions anymore or get blamed for not answering questions and they didn't ask

13:49 - and so well yeah that's that's kind of where i want we do need to we need to take what we've learned from these little

13:55 - individual things and then bring them back together and then awkwardly slam that information into

14:00 - each other and try and make a story out of it like a sandwich yeah made of like an awkward sandwich of information clapped together like

14:07 - that that's not that's that is a coterie an awkward information sandwich that gets clapped together

14:13 - well thank you both for joining us in this you're welcome seventh episode of club aspects uh it was amazing looking

14:20 - very much looking forward to the fine finale me too um yeah so let's let's switch over

14:25 - to our other table and see what they have to say

14:30 - dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance

14:36 - and now it's time for joey rasul and abria iron gar

14:41 - yay sorry i'm yelling our name dang it immediately i forgot about that

14:47 - oh never forget i think i think rhaegos sunk i think the ship sunk um excuse me when

14:54 - where what did i miss what did you do in your scene well you weren't in it so

15:00 - um well i assumed it was just pining about margo i wasn't i wasn't prepped to talk

15:06 - about rego i'll be honest i that's fair yeah we didn't so we we didn't really get to

15:12 - watch each other yeah so you are our conduit for finding out what happened

15:17 - each other's seeds oh this is exciting um what's really funny though is that

15:23 - the audio on the stream went out during your scene so i don't know either [Laughter]

15:30 - i will say though let's start with the obvious uh which you both did you saw each other though so you saw what each

15:36 - other was wearing can we talk about wardrobe we talk about that like suit

15:42 - yes god sir so okay we can start there yeah so um

15:48 - i brought in a bunch of stuff uh for rey to begin with and you know like we did

15:53 - uh camera tests of like what looks good and all that and then i had a bunch of like gray and silver and uh

15:59 - mayana was monopolizing the purple a little bit um then i was like oh okay so i have this

16:04 - uh jacket i don't know if i'm ever gonna get to use it and then it became this kind of

16:10 - one day uh meeting the camarilla thing and i was like okay well maybe this

16:16 - maybe this becomes the camarilla jacket maybe this becomes the like cam jacket yeah and it has this kind of like trail

16:24 - feeling of like the jacket of betrayal did you know yes what what no no i spent my entire scene

16:32 - pining over fuego thank you um the betrayal was that fuego he did he

16:37 - feels betrayed that because he loves you so much good but it just because it is a little it's

16:44 - a little flashy and a little ostentatious and it's not a it's not a subtle jacket so it became this thing of like

16:51 - uh almost going into the camarilla in a way

16:56 - of like almost showing what the bronze like being in the bronx for a year has done

17:03 - but i'm like i'm still me but i did change but uh so you know kind of trying to

17:08 - give a little bit of an air of ray is different from when you all saw him a

17:13 - year ago yeah when he's back in the bronx so well so i mean he

17:19 - as a character left the bronx when he was like 12 years old or no not 12. he left after school

17:26 - was 12 year old ray flashy uh no he was like a studious kid who

17:32 - like saw school as his way out of the bronx and like

17:37 - all of his friends are like yeah i'm gonna get out of the bronx doing music just like you

17:44 - go buddy and and yeah he he

17:50 - doesn't have like he doesn't have a lot of respect for that he doesn't have a lot of because he feels like

17:56 - he you know had to claw to get his way out of the bronx and then you know we

18:02 - haven't really delved into what happened when you know he was alive and tried to

18:07 - come back maybe we'll touch on that uh one day one day

18:12 - abrea also since since your last visit to club ospecs um you're you're bringing out some

18:18 - pretty cool accessories as well thanks yeah uh when uh when we were

18:25 - first starting to like figure out what the characters were going to look like uh i got some like you know the cool

18:31 - like little halloween store spirit halloween vampire fangs and suffering dash i could not sound normal at

18:38 - all wearing them so i kept trying to figure out like what's something that like

18:44 - has the sort of cadence of like fangs and draws your eyes to her mouth which

18:49 - is the source of her power and then found this like very cool accessory online bought it twice and then was like okay you look like a show

18:57 - pony now this is cool maybe let's wear this show pony fuego the show founder of the show she's the lip is on

19:04 - her she's looking trolling and ray and his betrayal jacket

19:09 - you can't spell betrayal without ray oh no

19:14 - oh no oh it was coming we set it up early i do

19:20 - want to say though i think it's very cool that like uh fuego's like thing for this episode

19:25 - was having the blood tears which i always thought was like the coolest thing yeah main vampire that like that's true like if they cry they cry blood

19:32 - that's just what it is yeah and with such a signature idea and i think in a sort of like parallel

19:38 - to rey going and wearing like his flashiest jacket in this private moment away from the coterie sort of being a

19:45 - different version of himself when the rest of the group isn't around fuego like giving in to her emotions and like

19:51 - a very visible way something she would try hard not to do in front of the coterie yeah she just still isn't quite

19:57 - sure where she stands with them and how she feels about them but could open herself up to like a visually impactful

20:03 - moment in a safe space away away from the group and i think like in very different ways

20:09 - they were still kind of communicating the same idea yeah that's cool and good for us for doing that on purpose like we

20:14 - planned we know that is true though you sort of we got to see a bit more of each of

20:19 - those characters at you know outside of the coterie and and i also find it really fascinating

20:25 - because you know both of your characters are newer to being dead um

20:31 - and i love watching them learn about what they are because they both kind of come from a place that no one you know

20:37 - sat them down and was like these are the rules um and so for instance ray uh with

20:42 - the the cigarette scene i thought was really interesting i didn't know we could do that

20:48 - although like i do like that uh as mechanically it takes rousing the blood

20:54 - which means that you might get hungrier every time you do it so if you're like a

20:59 - pack a day a purse kind of person that's uh it's a real dangerous night

21:05 - is ray a pack a day person no a ray ray wasn't that bad and ray kade ray ray that's what they call uh

21:13 - moore had a problem with cigars than cigarettes but it mechanically is all kind of you know

21:20 - slaking the lust the same way yeah that's fun and then um on the on

21:25 - the other side uh fuego margot is uh she's it's kind of a i don't want

21:31 - to say a sponge so much is just constantly asking questions yeah uh what has been your favorite thing that to

21:39 - learn in character oh man uh i super enjoy uh

21:46 - fuego's sort of learning about like what different

21:52 - clans are like i think in her brain and in mind it's doing this very fun astrology thing

21:59 - of like oh that's a very virgo thing to say like oh all gangrel are like what like there's just something very fun

22:05 - about this like prescribed sense of like i guess it is innate because you're like born into this other life and like this

22:12 - this sense of like here's this determinist aspect to being offered

22:19 - eternity and it's such a it's such a fun little thing to like a light on and i think that's beyond her immediate concerns for

22:27 - like what do i need to know to keep myself from getting uh killed in these streets she's just sort of endlessly

22:32 - fascinated with like the permutations of like different kinds of kindred so every time

22:38 - she hears something new about a different clan or a different like power set she's like oh that's great yeah i

22:44 - have that is that in my like star chart like how do i be a part of that though

22:50 - um that is kind of fun to think of it as horoscopes yeah um i so i'll be a little conduity for you

22:57 - both of y'all in your stories kind of revisited your past

23:02 - or um went back to you know it was it was like you were trying to reach out to your human life a

23:09 - bit yeah but for very different reasons could we elucidate uh what what were each of your

23:16 - character's reasoning for trying to get back to that oh yeah uh oh my gosh thank you

23:22 - uh i think that like the very simple answer is uh it was a mechanical problem of like okay we're gonna have to resolve

23:29 - the sort of like humanity uh threat that the choices i made in a previous

23:34 - episode yielded results that had to be dealt with rude i hate consequences could you imagine

23:41 - but i love a world in which uh the sort of stated

23:46 - characterization for fuego is that she's this like part of the community everyone

23:51 - is family uh she was growing she was acculturated in such like a deeply

23:57 - humanist idea that yeah she just i just don't think she knows how to not

24:03 - be that and the threat of somehow losing something that is such a core pillar of

24:09 - personality to her in this like mechanical way and like a

24:14 - choice way like was just so devastating and exciting and oh god it was it was

24:20 - cool i stand by it that was great and i was freaking out the entire time

24:26 - i don't know if i answered your question i think i think you did i think you did i feel like that was the a little

24:31 - different than rey's reasoning well actually i like the parallels to it because mine kind of came from a

24:37 - mechanical need as well because i had aggravated willpower damage from the last episode

24:43 - and the only way to heal that was to push towards my ambition

24:49 - which is to get back into manhattan and be accepted into

24:54 - some facsimile of my old life so i had to make progress towards that

25:00 - to gain that willpower back oh that's cool i love it when mechanics push a character choice yeah it's yeah

25:07 - yeah and it just yeah and i love how you both embraced that and didn't make them just mechanics they were

25:12 - motivations when system serves story it's just so guys so good can we take a

25:18 - second to talk about how great you both are oh my god um i i i answered your uh your colleagues

25:25 - as well and i would like you guys to tell each other what you like about each other's characters oh my gosh how long

25:31 - do you have oh my god this is amazing that's right you can never here's the thing

25:36 - here's the thing tell me how great i thought about how much of a slow burn

25:41 - this game was going to be and i was like got to sit down next to the amazing

25:47 - abria and like early on early on

25:53 - she was so unafraid to make such strong bold decisions

26:00 - as a player and then as a character immediately regret them

26:06 - which is such a such a dichotomy that it's like you how are you this good

26:12 - of a player but then also this good of a character at the same time oh my god like when you

26:18 - say like that it does sound a little bit like the characters like oh why

26:27 - well can i can i compliment back now yeah yeah of course okay like i set you up for it so oh my god

26:33 - yes okay so here's the thing you came in and i think yeah i i love having a character that's

26:40 - sort of out of the gate like hey my backstory is not the interesting thing it's what you do once everyone knows it

26:45 - so i'm going to come in screaming it and you built this like beautiful

26:50 - fortress of a character and i was like oh i built that sort of nosy family community bully

26:57 - i'm going to pick on you the entire time and it was just so lovely to have a

27:03 - character that like had every reason in the world to have so many defenses up and every like

27:09 - choice to be withholding and a little off-putting like it's just so

27:14 - meticulously crafted and it becomes like this sort of puzzle in the middle of the gameplay of like what's the thing i can

27:21 - do that margot can like needle rey in a way that someone

27:26 - who deeply cares about someone and wants to know them better and like even if it causes him to blow up

27:32 - an emotion is something indifference is death and uh man

27:38 - even even beyond like our characters like vibes every

27:43 - it's to me i think you are playing like what i

27:49 - think of when i think of like power gamey like cool vampires of just like that cold
