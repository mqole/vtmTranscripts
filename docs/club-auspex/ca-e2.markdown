1:45 - the show or la by night uh for a while

1:48 - behind the scenes uh up into

1:51 - directing uh the final season of la by

1:54 - night and got to play for all of five

1:57 - minutes uh to finish out one of the the

2:01 - final scenes of the uh series uh

2:04 - and

2:05 - kind of got bitten by the uh

2:07 - by the fangs and i was like i want to

2:09 - play

2:10 - i want to play a full series if i can

2:13 - you got the vampire bright and then

2:15 - mayano tell me a little bit about your

2:16 - background absolutely i've been doing

2:18 - improv since i was 16 years old

2:20 - i've been playing tabletop rpgs for

2:22 - about

2:23 - four years

2:24 - and i did a monthly show uh that was

2:28 - like choose your own adventure themed um

2:31 - that was very silly and like about

2:32 - dating simulators and all that stuff so

2:34 - a lot of role play in my background but

2:36 - not in this capacity so i'm very excited

2:38 - to be here so how's it been for y'all at

2:40 - the table awesome

2:42 - better than i expected yeah all right

2:44 - well that's that's good that's a good

2:46 - place to start um so now we're gonna get

2:48 - a little bit more into your characters

2:50 - you're

2:51 - you guys have developed two very

2:53 - different characters your whole codery

2:55 - has four very different characters and

2:58 - like many role-playing games you kind of

3:01 - start off the players in a situation

3:03 - that forces them together whether they

3:05 - like it or not

3:06 - how do you feel it's going with these

3:09 - four different characters you know being

3:11 - forced together

3:14 - i was expecting

3:16 - more thrash but i think that for a

3:19 - myriad of different reasons all four of

3:21 - us are very objective focused and i

3:23 - think prioritize

3:25 - helping each other

3:27 - um

3:28 - less for like selfish reasons and more

3:30 - so just because it feels like the right

3:31 - thing to do yeah i think there's um you

3:34 - know a level of you know

3:36 - discord between the you know all of us

3:39 - but uh

3:41 - you know for for me i'm very much trying

3:43 - to be annoyed but not annoying

3:47 - uh and finally going yeah well

3:50 - i don't know you tell me

3:52 - uh but you know like trying to find that

3:54 - balance of like being true to you know

3:56 - how the character would think and react

3:57 - but then also like keeping everything

3:59 - moving forward and being able to like

4:01 - find that next moment to to pick up and

4:04 - yeah keep it all going yeah and

4:07 - do you find that that's getting easier

4:09 - as you're going or has it has that been

4:11 - challenging at any point are you are you

4:13 - still dping in your head oh yeah well

4:16 - that's that's still a thing i'm still

4:18 - like every now and then i'm just like oh

4:19 - that's cool lighting change we keep

4:21 - yelling he's really cool

4:23 - and he just won't he can't let go yeah

4:25 - the five minutes before we roll i'm

4:26 - always like if you need help fixing the

4:28 - i can no i can't i'll stay here well for

4:31 - you folks at home uh joey did help us

4:33 - in the beginning he set up everything

4:36 - and then became talent so you're still

4:37 - involved even in this series behind the

4:39 - scenes

4:40 - um and even

4:42 - yeah come in the morning do your camera

4:44 - stuff and sit down

4:46 - get forced into makeup but we also have

4:48 - like such an awesome team behind the

4:49 - cameras that i like came in today and i

4:52 - was like you guys need anything

4:53 - no everything's good oh you're oh i'll

4:57 - just uh

4:58 - i'll i'll wait that's so weird

5:00 - play then yeah

5:02 - but i was just like i have nothing to do

5:05 - i'm gonna guess i'm gonna work on my

5:06 - character oh no this is the scary

5:08 - part well speaking of the scary part so

5:12 - working on your characters uh you have a

5:14 - very interesting character so you're a

5:16 - gang girl

5:17 - um he's um

5:20 - he's gangry he's uh very yeah you have

5:23 - taken was it you've got one

5:26 - wanting one composure one composure

5:29 - the opposite yeah so you have one in

5:30 - composure

5:32 - so and that was a decision

5:34 - yeah so when you're building out a

5:35 - character uh at least the way we were

5:37 - building them out you have to take uh

5:40 - one in one of the um

5:42 - uh attributes and you know you get a

5:45 - four in the other and the others are

5:46 - scattered around so you know looking at

5:48 - everything i was like what is going to

5:50 - be the thing that

5:52 - is you know ray's weakness

5:54 - and

5:56 - having him fly off the handle

5:58 - kind of with slight provocation

6:01 - um

6:03 - is

6:05 - ties into the beast that we all kind of

6:08 - know

6:09 - very well for me so i was like oh yeah

6:10 - that's just

6:12 - an extension of what we already think of

6:14 - as the beast kind of yeah nibbling at

6:17 - you is raver on the handle to fly off of

6:19 - i feel like he's always so he has

6:23 - uh

6:25 - a specific uh trait called high

6:27 - functioning addict

6:30 - which normally uh addiction within the

6:33 - game is a flaw uh and his is

6:36 - specifically with smoking and with

6:38 - nicotine uh and that

6:41 - calms him down a little bit when it's in

6:44 - his bloodstream so when he gets to feed

6:45 - off of someone that has been smoking uh

6:49 - he calms a little bit and that kind of

6:52 - mimics that ebb and flow of someone who

6:56 - is addicted to nicotine of like when

6:57 - they haven't had it in a while they're

6:59 - angry and they're agitated

7:01 - and you know

7:03 - having that calms them down so

7:06 - dealing with that that thing of like are

7:08 - you guys sure you don't want him to

7:11 - have have a drink of uh someone with

7:13 - nicotine in their blood because he's

7:15 - going to get annoying

7:16 - so for your first foray at the table you

7:18 - decided to make it as complicated for

7:20 - yourself as possible

7:22 - yeah i'd seen i'd seen alex try and make

7:24 - it as complicated as possible for him

7:26 - all of l.a by night he'd come you know

7:28 - home being like ah it's not that bad

7:30 - it's it's fine i'm definitely not gonna

7:32 - die i was like yeah yeah so i you know

7:35 - assume that that's the case and so far

7:38 - he's been so wrong yeah but i like it a

7:42 - lot i think it's a great uh wrench to

7:44 - throw into everything it's fantastic

7:47 - it's very fun

7:48 - and then with your character yeah you've

7:50 - also got some some dichotomy maybe some

7:53 - background you're trying to um get away

7:55 - from correcto and then also you're

7:57 - playing uh ravnos here i am playing

7:59 - ravnos which is the first time we've

8:00 - seen that uh in in the vampire streaming

8:03 - series so what drew you to ravnos the

8:06 - quiz that i took that told me i was

8:08 - ravnos

8:10 - um okay and then everything oh my god

8:13 - well you know i got a little a little

8:15 - email and a suggestion uh to help you

8:18 - pick a clan uh and so i took the quiz uh

8:21 - totally just normal and i got ravnos and

8:24 - uh alex told me that that was disturbing

8:25 - information

8:27 - um but after i was like well i have to

8:29 - do that now and the fact that uh ravnos

8:31 - is one of those clans that doesn't get a

8:32 - lot of airplay i found very interesting

8:34 - because their their curse is

8:37 - really uh crazy and we haven't gotten a

8:39 - chance to talk about it too much um and

8:41 - i'm not sure if i should spoil what the

8:43 - curse is or not so i won't yeah that's

8:46 - that's fine yeah but it may come up soon

8:48 - so well what about the clan

8:50 - can you talk about it without spoiling

8:52 - anything that we haven't they're nomadic

8:54 - okay they don't stick around in the same

8:56 - place for very long and um

8:58 - i think that that is a very attractive

9:00 - uh trait to align with serif and some of

9:03 - the things that she's dealing with

9:05 - she doesn't want to be close to the

9:08 - place where she came from

9:10 - okay so you don't want to be close or

9:11 - serif doesn't want to be close to the

9:12 - place where she came from whereas rey

9:14 - just doesn't want to be in brooklyn

9:16 - well so yeah rey

9:19 - doesn't really

9:20 - like being back in the bronx ray's a

9:23 - character who's originally from the

9:24 - bronx um but uh you know left to go to

9:28 - manhattan and kind of

9:30 - chase uh chase his fortune

9:32 - um so

9:34 - he was a self-made man and kind of built

9:37 - himself up in the

9:39 - in manhattan

9:40 - and then just one day

9:42 - everything goes wrong and

9:44 - you know

9:45 - a violent embrace

9:47 - uh takes place

9:48 - and now he's back in the bronx and it

9:51 - kind of feels like starting from square

9:53 - one again so i don't think he

9:55 - dislikes the bronx but he kind of

9:57 - associates it with

9:58 - level one because this is where i

10:00 - started the first time and this is where

10:01 - i am again so how do y'all think these

10:04 - two characters one who doesn't want to

10:05 - stick around anywhere and the other one

10:06 - who is

10:07 - feels like this is level one for him

10:09 - almost a sign of failure to be in this

10:11 - you've been given a territory

10:14 - in this location

10:16 - is that

10:17 - i love the bronx it is the opposite of

10:20 - where uh i was and so for that reason i

10:23 - think it's very appealing to serif

10:26 - um and she enjoys how

10:28 - gritty and messy it is

10:31 - and uh so for that reason i think she

10:33 - feels very protective of the bronx

10:34 - specifically so she finds different

10:36 - reasons to stick around

10:38 - areas of it

10:40 - um and i think

10:41 - you couldn't want to be and there any

10:44 - less yeah i mean like it's it's more

10:47 - that it's a reminder for him and i

10:50 - there's something about him that would

10:51 - like to make the bronx better but you

10:53 - know there are so many different

10:55 - definitions of what that means

10:57 - that you know if rey and fuego have a

11:00 - conversation about what the you know

11:02 - what makes the bronx better i'm sure

11:04 - they'll come up with very different

11:06 - uh answers

11:08 - yeah

11:09 - um so i'm gonna delve a little bit into

11:11 - kind of

11:13 - maybe a little bit of meta gaming but

11:14 - just uh

11:17 - player let's say player failure

11:20 - as a player obviously your character

11:22 - doesn't want to fail your character

11:23 - doesn't want to necessarily be hurt or

11:26 - wounded or almost die but as a player

11:29 - how does that feel to

11:30 - go into a dramatic situation where

11:32 - something happens like i don't know

11:33 - you're thrown out of a window

11:36 - i mean

11:37 - i

11:38 - try really hard

11:40 - to

11:41 - never look at it as

11:43 - a failure it's like did the dice tell

11:45 - you to go left or right right not did

11:48 - you succeed or fail

11:49 - um because

11:51 - as a player you might have different

11:52 - goals than your character

11:54 - and so then you start to start you know

11:56 - have the question of well who failed did

11:57 - the player fail or did the character

11:59 - fail

12:00 - the answer is neither failed you're

12:02 - going this way instead of that way so

12:05 - um one of the things that i kind of

12:07 - realized in that fight with airbox was

12:11 - like okay if they knew that

12:14 - rey was going to fight because there's

12:16 - no way they didn't know rey was going to

12:18 - fight why are they doing this maybe it's

12:21 - to

12:22 - test

12:23 - uh margot and seraph to see how they

12:26 - would react

12:27 - so

12:28 - whether that's true or not that's how

12:30 - ray starts to rationalize it in his head

12:32 - and starts to go okay so i have to put

12:34 - up this fight and i have to do this and

12:36 - i'm gonna fail and i'm gonna fall out

12:37 - the window and then that's why you know

12:39 - the first thing he asks is like okay how

12:40 - did they do

12:41 - did they what did they do they react

12:43 - they fail the test

12:44 - because i did exactly what i was

12:46 - supposed to do in this test

12:47 - which is get beat up yeah

12:49 - i like it because it's a story nerd

12:52 - person uh you don't want characters who

12:55 - aren't challenged by things and even as

12:57 - somebody who likes to write as well like

13:00 - you feel this protectiveness around your

13:02 - characters you don't want to put them

13:04 - through something

13:05 - hard or painful

13:06 - but ultimately that is what makes for

13:08 - really compelling stories yeah the fact

13:10 - that they made it out to the other side

13:12 - is what's interesting and so having dice

13:14 - be a mechanism by which characters have

13:17 - to face difficult things and not succeed

13:20 - is i think the thing you're trying to

13:22 - always capture in a written story so we

13:24 - just don't have to worry about that part

13:26 - even if sarah clearly enjoys uh

13:29 - learning from pain i mean she kept her

13:31 - bullet in the first episode sure did

13:32 - philip that shot her would is that a

13:34 - common thing for her to keep

13:37 - i think i think serif is is a character

13:40 - that i myself don't fully understand uh

13:42 - she does things i don't think you're

13:44 - supposed to admit that oh i mean

13:46 - um as i as i get to to know her and

13:49 - sense what she wants to do there's not

13:51 - necessarily always a rhyme or reason to

13:53 - it but i think she thought it'd be fun

13:54 - to keep it um but there is a lot of

13:58 - things in her past that are defined by

14:00 - uh ugliness and and uh

14:04 - acceptance of that that wasn't allowed

14:06 - for her so i think anything that reminds

14:07 - her that the world is a messy

14:09 - complicated place is something that

14:11 - she's attracted to

14:13 - um

14:15 - yeah i like that so

14:17 - that's embracing embracing the the

14:20 - ugliness the messiness the

14:22 - to become better

14:24 - so

14:26 - i'm gonna

14:26 - switch gears slightly and just talk more

14:28 - about y'all as people

14:30 - outside the game

14:32 - i know you've both role-played a lot in

14:34 - the past uh have you how much experience

14:36 - you have with vampire specifically

14:38 - before this show i know obviously uh you

14:42 - had a lot of experience my experience

14:44 - has literally been like sitting

14:46 - you know 10 feet off of the set watching

14:48 - it and that's about it i've played i

14:50 - played one session of like

14:54 - a variant version of mortals and one you

14:56 - know stream game for charity and that

14:58 - was about it

14:59 - so i used to like a game called detroit

15:00 - become human and in that game there's an

15:02 - actor named brian deckard and brian

15:04 - deckard was on vampire and he played a

15:07 - prince and so i watched that episode and

15:08 - then i was like ooh sick and then i

15:10 - watched more episodes and that is my

15:13 - experience of vampire the masquerade

15:15 - great so how is it actually being a

15:18 - table compared to what you sort of

15:20 - thought it would be

15:24 - it's it's it's so interesting feeling

15:28 - like

15:29 - there's this this wide

15:32 - land

15:32 - and you're not really sure where in the

15:35 - land you want to go are supposed to go

15:38 - you know would be the right place to go

15:40 - and trying to figure out in the moment

15:42 - while also being respectful of everybody

15:44 - else's understanding that they're

15:45 - looking at the same piece of land that

15:47 - you are um

15:49 - both our territory and also

15:50 - metaphorically so i think it's like it

15:53 - you feel like there's so many options

15:54 - but you also want to be cognizant that

15:56 - you don't want to take from other

15:58 - people's

15:59 - impulses as well so it's it's very yes

16:01 - and and very like okay let me kind of

16:03 - sense this out

16:05 - how's joey at that do you like playing i

16:07 - think joey is so talented honestly and i

16:10 - think you make such interesting choices

16:12 - i think you bring our characters into it

16:14 - fun interesting conflict that we uh

16:17 - probably wouldn't get into otherwise and

16:19 - all of your interactions are so fun to

16:20 - watch that sometimes i just i just i'm

16:22 - just lucky to be there i will say that i

16:24 - did kind of plan on bringing everybody

16:26 - into conflict i was like okay what is

16:28 - the normal like

16:29 - chaos gremlin of an rpg like how would

16:31 - you do that with like

16:33 - just anger and being a crotchety old man

16:37 - yeah that'll work i like it so much i

16:39 - think it's awesome

16:41 - angry crotch jeweled man chaos gremlin

16:43 - yeah

16:44 - all right well that's i guess that's the

16:46 - best way to play role-playing games is

16:49 - chaos gremlins

16:50 - [Laughter]

16:53 - um thank you both so much for joining us

16:55 - on club ospecs um now that you've you've

16:58 - gone through the process do you have any

16:59 - more thoughts on an opening line do you

17:01 - feel like we're

17:02 - there's a new motto oh man

17:06 - i don't know i'm i'm having such a weird

17:08 - like out of body experience just even

17:09 - being here like you know to step from

17:12 - playing at a table

17:14 - to then playing for a stream is its own

17:17 - thing and like

17:18 - the the change of how you played ha was

17:21 - was

17:22 - there's a little bit of a difference in

17:24 - how you play and now like even sitting

17:26 - here talking to you like i can't get out

17:28 - of rey's voice half the time because i'm

17:30 - like oh yeah we're on camera we do the

17:32 - thing that we do on camera now oh this

17:34 - is a different kind of uh so my brain is

17:37 - already just like

17:39 - dealing with so many things from today

17:43 - i don't know a new slogan i i liked what

17:45 - was it show me your mind show me your

17:47 - mind yeah i think that's good we'll do
