2:23 - come in and work with incredible people
2:26 - honestly and it's just such a treat to
2:29 - go
2:30 - back to annabelle like especially
2:32 - annabelle at the end of the last season
2:34 - of la by night because she's already
2:36 - gone on such such a journey yeah and now
2:40 - she's journeying to new york yeah
2:43 - and abrea you've you've obviously played
2:45 - with erica at tabletop before oh my god
2:47 - yes but this is your first time not only
2:49 - is vampires also you've had you know two
2:52 - episodes and some session zeros with
2:54 - with our codery but uh
2:56 - bringing in a new a new person a fifth
2:58 - person
2:59 - so
3:00 - so what was that like for you oh i just
3:03 - beat my mic i'm so sorry

3:12 - what i'm doing uh it was just it was so
3:14 - incredible and again we talked before
3:16 - about uh i came up came up that's so
3:19 - crazy but watching l.a by night and i
3:21 - always loved annabelle
3:23 - wait what oh my god are you kidding look
3:25 - let's be very clear
3:27 - a lot of fuego is like what if annabelle
3:30 - but
3:36 - [Music]
3:38 - yes
3:39 - but there's a lot of what if annabelle
3:41 - butter
3:43 - because vampires are sexy and she's like
3:45 - i'm gonna lean in
3:46 - just like that book told me to
3:49 - but it's very fun to kind of like walk
3:51 - down an interesting street of like i
3:53 - remember annabelle like learning about
3:55 - the world and how interesting it was and
3:56 - like getting to go through that again
3:58 - with you on the other side of it i'm
4:01 - just like now you are you are vampire
4:03 - daddy now please explain we are all a
4:05 - bunch of beautiful dum-dums yeah yeah
4:08 - like gorgeous little idiot it's so
4:11 - great yeah so that's why we're the
4:13 - vampire daddy shirt because it's like
4:14 - she's definitely stepped into that role
4:16 - and obviously she's still young and
4:19 - still she has a lot to become the
4:20 - teacher but yeah but she's like i know
4:23 - more than you guys and that's bad that's
4:26 - also easy because we mostly don't know
4:28 - anything exactly
4:30 - and what were annabelle's first
4:31 - impressions of this codery like oh yeah
4:33 - they i mean like she like peeks out and
4:35 - just like immediately clocks them as
4:37 - kendra and it's like wow that's not
4:40 - great
4:41 - which is not great
4:43 - also that they
4:45 - don't seem like they're a neighborhood
4:47 - watch like it i guess technically
4:50 - actually um
4:52 - the codery in la by night started out as
4:55 - that too we were supposed to be like
4:57 - scooby in the gang and immediately be
5:01 - dave walters is like i'm the baron now
5:05 - and that took the whole show in a
5:07 - different direction we were supposed to
5:08 - be solving like supernatural mysteries
5:11 - that was what we decided on at first so
5:13 - who knows like
5:15 - seeing this group starting out like that
5:17 - of like oh we're just like the
5:18 - homeowners association
5:20 - uh is
5:21 - like this dumb you're all dumb
5:24 - i hope that you
5:26 - get your act together and go after the
5:30 - camarilla and defend your people
5:34 - and yeah i i think she really would like
5:37 - to come back especially to talk to the
5:40 - baby maybe
5:41 - a baby and it's like i think there was a
5:44 - moment uh you know where i looked into
5:45 - bria and you know annabelle looking at
5:47 - fuego and realizing like oh you
5:51 - you are so
5:52 - lost and adrift and i
5:54 - can't like stay here to help you and and
5:57 - just like
5:58 - that moment i was like jumping back in
6:00 - time to what it was like
6:02 - no being like knowing nothing and then
6:04 - having the coterie adopt her and then
6:06 - yeah seeing this group that it's like
6:08 - okay
6:09 - there they need to get their act
6:11 - together but at least they all have each
6:12 - other which i think is important i think
6:15 - my favorite part of that was you're like
6:17 - having annabelle say it was the first
6:19 - time i think there was like a beautiful
6:21 - moment where you all kind of looked at
6:22 - each other like you did you did
6:24 - okay well dad said so i guess we all
6:27 - have to keep hanging out
6:29 - i
6:30 - i don't know if you remember um erica my
6:34 - very first episode on ellie by night
6:36 - because i was lucky enough to be able to
6:38 - join you all at the table for a couple
6:39 - of episodes
6:40 - but you were baby vamp at that time and
6:43 - during that episode was when
6:45 - uh family became a word yeah and you had
6:50 - emote that at a very similar moment
6:52 - where you were like are we are we family
6:56 - it's the same thing and i know fiona and
6:59 - and annabelle had a moment where you're
7:01 - a baby vamp and and you're like just
7:03 - asking everyone advice yeah it was so
7:05 - new and it was very interesting to now
7:08 - see
7:09 - that growth and where you know annabelle
7:11 - has come and is like
7:12 - oh god you're doing all the same things
7:15 - yeah it's wild and then also yes uh
7:19 - it was so funny too being at the table
7:22 - with alex
7:23 - and him playing a different character um
7:25 - who's extremely well adjusted wow
7:32 - immediately clocked like there's
7:34 - something
7:35 - you're
7:36 - gonna be there's gonna be something
7:38 - there's something there but yeah
7:41 - immediately annabelle uh
7:44 - shoop
7:45 - focus on play-doh yeah
7:48 - i i can't yeah i really hope i get to
7:50 - come back and still discuss some stuff
7:53 - and uh do you feel that fuego
7:56 - felt that same immediate connection with
7:58 - annabelle oh a hundred percent not just
8:01 - because like oh
8:03 - i i love her like so much of it was like
8:05 - locked into the like oh i absolutely
8:07 - with her politics like
8:09 - i like what she's saying there's also uh
8:11 - there was a nice moment of teasing out a
8:13 - little bit of fuego's like context with
8:16 - her sire and her relationship with her
8:17 - neighborhood but like there were it was
8:19 - basically like every cylinder she heard
8:22 - annabelle fire on she's like oh i get it
8:24 - yes
8:25 - i will offer you anything like i feel
8:27 - like you get when i'm where i'm coming
8:29 - from a conversation i haven't had with
8:31 - the codery yet but like you seem to
8:34 - already be there and i think it built uh
8:36 - a sort of like
8:38 - too much trust maybe like right up top
8:41 - that's another thing too that that's
8:43 - interesting because
8:44 - in terms of game mechanics
8:47 - you know like we we talk about a lot how
8:50 - actual play and live streaming is
8:52 - different than playing a home game and
8:54 - in a home game and when you have time
8:57 - you can be like hey i don't trust you
8:59 - like my character wouldn't really trust
9:01 - you or your characters but a combination
9:03 - of it being annabelle who
9:06 - like number one is
9:08 - like by nature wants to believe the best
9:10 - of people and also number two
9:12 - very much
9:14 - more powerful yeah the rest of these
9:15 - vampires and also me erica being like
9:18 - okay we've got
9:20 - an hour to go like i gotta just get in
9:22 - there and drop stuff on them and and
9:25 - build this rapport it's like that
9:27 - combination of like immediately you
9:29 - gotta open the door and sto and not sort
9:32 - of dither around about it which i think
9:34 - is like the smart world of darkness
9:36 - player thing to do right did you feel
9:38 - like you had to
9:40 - work at rationalizing like because you
9:43 - annabelle basically was not only she
9:46 - could have done a lot of things she
9:47 - could have killed them she could have
9:48 - ignored them she could have just not
9:49 - left the widebago but instead she sort
9:52 - of was like oh hey this is my whole
9:53 - speech i'm going to convince all of you
9:55 - to fight the fight with me um
9:57 - did you feel like you had to do work a
9:59 - lot of work to rationalize that or do
10:02 - you feel like there was something about
10:03 - this codery
10:05 - that made annabelle feel like they
10:07 - needed they would would
10:09 - follow the message yeah i think it was
10:12 - um
10:14 - it was it was easy for her like i feel
10:17 - like it was very still very much in
10:18 - character for annabelle to do that and
10:20 - to like see these
10:23 - neo-neo neophytes we're not even like
10:26 - neonates we're just
10:28 - little fledgling babies yeah just like
10:30 - these babies and and
10:33 - you know
10:35 - want to
10:37 - want to take care of them which is
10:39 - crazy thinking about that character arc
10:42 - of her being baby annabelle was baby
10:45 - then becoming sort of a den mother yeah
10:48 - um
10:49 - and i think also
10:51 - she has sort of gotten the vibe to in
10:54 - new york and it's not
10:56 - it's so different than los angeles
10:58 - because everything feels like just sort
11:00 - of uh
11:02 - the annex are sort of really complacent
11:04 - it was kind of like where la was in the
11:06 - beginning of all of it
11:08 - um and yeah i think has joey
11:12 - brought up a good point of like why
11:14 - would we sort of like start a war yeah
11:16 - we don't need to but i think animal
11:19 - animal is right like war is coming to
11:21 - you you cannot hide in iraq and i love
11:24 - the way that alex sort of put a fine
11:26 - point on it and was like why should i
11:27 - care it's happening outside it's
11:29 - something else that
11:30 - that affects other people and not me
11:32 - yeah i'm like well okay supposing that
11:34 - you don't care about other people
11:37 - which is also a thing to examine perhaps
11:41 - you know also it will come to you and so
11:43 - and i think immediately with fuego and
11:47 - um with serif too
11:49 - um
11:50 - it resonating obviously resonating with
11:52 - them
11:53 - i think that that would be very
11:54 - interesting for annabelle yeah yeah
11:56 - because floyd was very tied to the bronx
11:58 - incredibly it was very strongly about it
12:00 - very protective can you talk
12:03 - a little we haven't gotten too into that
12:05 - i'd like to just like
12:06 - what does that mean for you abrea what
12:08 - does it mean for fuego what how why are
12:09 - the bronx so important
12:11 - what did you want to do uh for me uh
12:14 - kind of building the character i just
12:16 - wanted like as we were talking about the
12:18 - setting uh i don't know i always feel
12:21 - like the fun part of the assignment is
12:22 - like now tie yourself to it and i always
12:25 - think of like the people that i like
12:26 - love and respect most in spaces are like
12:30 - the person that walks down the street
12:31 - and everyone knows them
12:33 - and says hi in that very like i like
12:37 - it's like a soft mob boss thing like oh
12:39 - that's just you know the neighborhood's
12:41 - mom and if you have a problem she'll
12:43 - talk to you if you do something wrong
12:45 - she'll tell your parents before you even
12:47 - get home like i and i
12:49 - wanted fuego to come from like a really
12:51 - well-adjusted background like
12:53 - her mom is that in her neighborhood and
12:56 - everyone knows her and she calls
12:57 - everyone that she knows cousin because
12:59 - she doesn't know who she's actually
13:00 - really related to or not and was raised
13:03 - understanding that like everyone here
13:05 - that's like serving the community and
13:06 - looks out for each other those are your
13:08 - family and to have someone so inexorably
13:10 - tied to this place and then remove
13:12 - yourself via death and embrace and still
13:15 - have like the echoes of humanity that
13:18 - manifests primarily as protection of the
13:20 - neighborhood and like that
13:21 - re-contextualization like we were
13:23 - talking about like feeling a little bit
13:24 - like a superhero like i'm i'm batman now
13:27 - i can look out over them but i can't be
13:29 - a part of it but i still have that
13:30 - feeling
13:31 - it was really nice early in the episode
13:33 - uh when um
13:35 - when ray and i were going i got to
13:37 - finally talk about my convictions about
13:39 - like protect protect the bronx from
13:42 - anyone that would attack it and that
13:44 - means
13:45 - we get to do a little a little like
13:47 - murder every now and then so it was very
13:49 - fun getting to like lean in and have
13:52 - fuego like live her values and speak a
13:54 - little more to them i really love that
13:56 - that was something that definitely a
13:58 - parallel with annabelle with like
14:00 - so tied in with the community and her
14:02 - activism and her her family or like her
14:06 - her her lovers and and just like really
14:08 - having this tie and these stakes in the
14:11 - community because it makes
14:12 - what you're fighting for so much more
14:14 - important because i think that it was
14:16 - one huge delineation between
14:19 - traditional dungeons and dragons
14:20 - campaigns and
14:22 - la by night when i first started playing
14:23 - i was like oh there are consequences we
14:26 - live here yes we can't just like come in
14:29 - and take up the cause of people that we
14:31 - don't know and then like be heroes and
14:33 - then move on we have to maintain all the
14:36 - relationships that we have here like if
14:38 - we do a murder there will be
14:40 - consequences jason's gonna take a note
14:42 - it's gonna come up later yeah um where
14:44 - is a lot of times in dungeons and
14:46 - dragons as it's played popularly yes
14:49 - there are no consequences really there's
14:50 - no long-term consequences and so i think
14:54 - the the you know if if d is like
14:56 - dungeons and dragons vampire is like
15:00 - consequences yes and threats you know
15:03 - 100
15:04 - and and i i really like that and i love
15:06 - the fact of having a character that is
15:09 - so tied in that it really does give the
15:12 - whole entire campaign stakes like that
15:15 - yeah and then
15:17 - in the doing a little light murder you
15:19 - were trying to convince ray to kill
15:21 - someone yeah what do you i want to hear
15:24 - about oh
15:31 - the truth of the matter is uh
15:33 - fuego is a vengeroo like
15:36 - she
15:37 - has
15:38 - a soft command of power and influence
15:41 - and like it's so fun like digging into
15:43 - the mechanics and seeing
15:45 - how
15:46 - how the system wants you to care about
15:48 - being a ventrue and it felt so good in
15:51 - that moment and it was like little
15:52 - things that like joey has telegraphed
15:54 - over time where i was like oh
15:56 - my god doesn't have to do this herself
15:58 - she's not built to fight
15:59 - she's built to get what she wants
16:01 - and look
16:02 - here's this perfectly lovely
16:05 - uh machine built for killing let's use
16:08 - it
16:10 - so
16:10 - i think she didn't think of it like
16:13 - uh consciously but it's sort of
16:15 - realizing her power and her influence
16:17 - over people
16:19 - and then in that moment did not hesitate
16:21 - to use it and will not inspect uh maybe
16:25 - later but definitely not now will not
16:27 - like refuses to inspect like what that
16:29 - says about her and how she actually
16:30 - cares for the people that she now
16:32 - understands to be her coterie oh
16:35 - yeah that's something that you
16:37 - as a player like you abrea like
16:40 - you sort of knew you wanted to do
16:41 - something similar to that or did it just
16:43 - sort of just happen in the moment and
16:44 - you were just like oh this is what i'm
16:45 - doing uh it was something i kind of
16:47 - started thinking about after episode one
16:50 - when i realized the sort of bond that
16:52 - fuego and rey had up top and i was like
16:54 - okay uh the sort of i i like calling it
16:58 - my gm brain because it's always the most
16:59 - like adversarial part of my mind it's
17:01 - like how do you twist something and i
17:04 - was like oh if i was a meaner version of
17:05 - myself i would do hold on
17:08 - this is a game about monsters
17:11 - noted
17:12 - do this later and i think it's really
17:14 - interesting too that we as players had
17:17 - like a very distinct awareness of
17:20 - our character's beast and her
17:21 - character's flaws because like annabelle
17:23 - was sort of played as sort of like set
17:26 - up as we didn't have the certain talk
17:27 - back to to discuss this at the time but
17:29 - like she was set up as like yes sort of
17:31 - like the spark of revolution and like
17:33 - the the chosen one sort of a thing but
17:35 - at the same time like she
17:37 - was despite her you know pacifism
17:40 - like she caused the deaths of a lot of
17:43 - people
17:44 - and that is something that she sort of
17:46 - realized over the course of it because
17:48 - she was like yes i'm absolutely doing
17:50 - the right thing but that's her beast
17:52 - talking is like stir up rebel like
17:55 - fight the power and it's like sometimes
17:58 - damn the consequences and so that was a
18:01 - thing and sometimes
18:03 - like your character just gotta get what
18:05 - she wants you know but like at a cost
18:08 - because that's what our beasts tell us
18:10 - to do and it's so fun playing that as a
18:13 - player and like looking down and being
18:15 - like oh these are the mistakes that i'm
18:18 - knowingly putting my character into you
18:21 - know yeah um whereas they have no idea
18:24 - also oh go ahead i just want to say also
18:26 - it's very fun that i finally got to hear
18:29 - uh from my beast
18:31 - whose voice is one that like we talked
18:33 - about i was like oh i have
18:35 - complicated but incredibly strong
18:37 - feelings from my sire so hearing that
18:40 - voice specifically i i it was fun to
18:42 - note that was like oh i don't bump
18:44 - against my beasts the way i do i'm like
18:46 - yes okay yeah that sounds that sounds
18:49 - great and if you want to just stay and
18:50 - maybe we could go get ice cream okay
18:52 - goodbye yeah daddy issues vamp daddy
18:55 - issues vamp daddy issues baby
18:57 - yeah more parallels
19:00 - so
19:01 - we've talked about how annabelle came in
19:03 - with this arc and now the you know
19:05 - student has become the teacher
19:07 - what what advice would erica have i
19:09 - guess i don't have to talk about you in
19:10 - third person i could just say you
19:12 - what advice do you have for the players
19:16 - not just not just annabelle for the
19:17 - world oh man
19:19 - why would i presume to give advice to
19:21 - this like team of killers no
19:24 - daddy all right then i'll rephrase what
19:27 - advice they just just have fun because i
19:30 - remember
19:31 - starting out on this i was so nervous i
19:34 - was so nervous because it was the first
19:37 - you know i really hadn't done a game
19:39 - before i had done saga's sundry um on
19:42 - but i hadn't really done a serious sort
19:44 - of long-form campaign
19:46 - and uh
19:48 - you know i came in as the person who
19:50 - knew the least about vampire and and so
19:53 - i felt like there was a lot of pressure
19:54 - and i was like getting around my head
19:56 - and i took took it very seriously but
19:58 - you know i mean i feel like you know you
20:00 - had a whole damn summer you know
20:02 - you know the drill but like yeah it's
20:05 - just
20:06 - yeah say save these precious moments
20:09 - because like you have such a great crew
20:12 - and such a great cast and and
20:16 - like like we get to play you know and
20:19 - and i think
20:20 - there was a little bit of a pressure at
20:22 - first for for all of us we had to
20:24 - navigate that was like this is a job but
20:27 - also you know we're friends but also
20:30 - we you know sort of are trying to say
20:33 - something you know with an overworking
20:34 - story as opposed to kind of just taking
20:37 - it as it comes you know
20:39 - and it all works together really
20:40 - beautifully and really well and and so
20:43 - yeah just kind of enjoy that just
20:45 - sit in it okay
20:50 - [Music]
20:51 - if you if you could ask erica anything
20:53 - anything give me anything um what are
20:56 - you doing later are you free for a drink
20:58 - i'm in a vampire
21:02 - i guess it could be about
21:03 - you know other stuff but
21:06 - no i think uh the big one is how did you
21:10 - come about balancing like
21:13 - what
21:14 - your clan and sort of the expectation of
21:18 - kindred was versus like annabelle's in
21:21 - like initial
21:23 - priorities like how did you go about
21:25 - thinking about it was walking down that
21:27 - it was really interesting we we kind of
21:29 - joked that annabelle was like uh
21:32 - schrodinger's brouha right where is it
21:34 - like
21:35 - is she
21:36 - a pacifist because like that's what she
21:40 - believes in and that's like what she did
21:42 - in life you know or and like that's it's
21:45 - the right thing to do or is it because
21:47 - that's what her beast is telling her to
21:49 - do
21:50 - like is it telling her okay you need to
21:52 - rebel do that by not ever killing and
21:55 - drinking somebody yeah which was like a
21:58 - really weird thing to think about fun
22:01 - you know
22:02 - so i i think it was
22:04 - it was so interesting to kind of subvert
22:07 - the expectations of this specific clan
22:10 - yeah to sort of build into what her
22:13 - personal goals were and that was i love
22:16 - that like jason got to play like we got
22:18 - to play with that and and just sort of
22:20 - test that too yeah um so good yeah
22:25 - so i would say i would say that like i
22:26 - would say sort of and it seems like
22:28 - you're doing it with your character
22:30 - where it's like you're very about the
22:32 - community and you're very about like
22:34 - sort of spreading that you know wealth
22:36 - and that happiness and everything but
22:39 - like how does that manifest as your bees
22:42 - we'll see
