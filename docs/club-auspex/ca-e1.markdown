1:29 - it's i mean
1:32 - from previous shows we've done in the
1:33 - world of darkness it's we've had a lot
1:35 - of we've had a lot of questions that we
1:36 - haven't really had time or the ability
1:38 - to answer so this is going to be
1:40 - hopefully a nice thing we get to do of
1:42 - answering some questions that you know

1:56 - like a cool lead-in phrase though just

2:00 - i feel like club specs also needs it's
2:02 - like yeah and you guys are the first
2:04 - guest so
2:05 - you have to make it up
2:07 - you don't want this
2:08 - no
2:10 - club
2:12 - i don't know show me your mind
2:15 - uh kind of you know what i like it it's
2:18 - a direct challenge yeah there you
2:20 - me your mind go have to like you cannot
2:22 - blink while you say it
2:24 - oh uh i'm not great at that not blinking
2:27 - she's really good at blinking sorry
2:30 - i'm so glad you framed that you're
2:32 - amazing at bloomberg okay hold on what
2:33 - are we here to talk about
2:37 - are you ready to show me your mind yes
2:39 - all right let's let's start with the
2:40 - obvious about that later the first
2:42 - impressions so uh you know
2:45 - alex
2:46 - jasper is very different than isaac yes
2:49 - you've been playing jasper now for five
2:51 - seasons
2:53 - um and so what what what was sort of the
2:56 - biggest
2:58 - the biggest obvious differences the
2:59 - biggest subtle differences what was
3:00 - difficult about
3:02 - switching gears was it difficult yeah it
3:04 - was um
3:06 - jasper was made at a very different time
3:08 - in my life there's a lot of backstory
3:09 - that goes into that of like why i made
3:11 - him and what was feeding him at the time
3:12 - and as i played jasper it got a lot more
3:14 - difficult to play jasper because i
3:17 - wasn't in the same emotional space as i
3:18 - was when i was creating him uh there's a
3:20 - lot i won't go into all that but like
3:22 - it's uh it i wanted to make isaac be
3:26 - very different than jasper both visually
3:29 - and as a person and um jasper had a lot
3:32 - of internal conflict and a lot of
3:35 - a lot of bad impulses that he was trying
3:37 - to make better in possibly the worst way
3:39 - he could have done it and so i wanted to
3:41 - make a character that was much less
3:43 - internally conflicted and much
3:46 - more okay with himself
3:49 - whether or not he's a good person is not
3:52 - the point it's that he's totally okay
3:55 - with whatever he does
3:57 - and um
3:59 - he
4:01 - comes from a very different background
4:02 - and is
4:03 - has a very different relationship to the
4:05 - world around him and doesn't
4:08 - as far as right now as of episode 1 does
4:10 - not hate being a kindred
4:13 - and it actually fits him a little better
4:14 - so that's kind of what i wanted to
4:16 - explore with isaac all right yeah and
4:18 - then abria
4:20 - you are new at least to the the official
4:23 - sort of vampire streaming world uh what
4:26 - what are your first impressions coming
4:27 - into the table like how is this
4:28 - different than other games you've
4:29 - streamed
4:30 - oh uh it's fun because i definitely
4:34 - started as a fan of l.a liners so yeah
4:37 - look i'm here to let you know that the
4:40 - parasocial come up has been unreal
4:44 - of watching all these stories and
4:46 - when i was like this was sort of
4:49 - fundamental of viewing as i was learning
4:52 - about rpgs and learning that you could
4:53 - tell different kinds of stories with
4:54 - different kinds of tone and i think it
4:56 - was
4:57 - so fun to like come in here and settle
5:00 - into a tone that was just so
5:02 - deeply different from everything else
5:04 - like i
5:05 - like jokes
5:07 - and
5:08 - definitely feel very like
5:09 - improvisational and like light
5:12 - uh is usually like my tone and timbre
5:15 - but coming in here and like there's a
5:17 - cadence that's in a mood that's set
5:18 - really well
5:20 - that uh
5:21 - it feels
5:22 - heavy in this really nice way yeah
5:25 - not oppressive but like a weighted
5:27 - blanket that you're like you are secure
5:29 - in the like
5:30 - world affirming this like set of
5:33 - emotions that the mechanics want you to
5:35 - like go through and explore and it's
5:37 - just i mean we're only an episode in but
5:39 - it already feels uh so fun and
5:41 - interesting to like dig into the kind of
5:43 - character that uh hopefully you guys
5:45 - will see over time yeah yeah yeah it is
5:48 - interesting the the because so much of
5:49 - improv in a generalized sense and
5:51 - people's perception of improv is related
5:53 - to comedy yeah
5:54 - and being spontaneous being funny
5:57 - and having to improv with and i mean
5:59 - obviously there's still jokes in the
6:00 - world of darkness there are still funny
6:02 - things that happen but like
6:03 - coming at it from a dramatic perspective
6:05 - and not every decision being like what's
6:07 - going to make my friends laugh what's
6:09 - going to make the audience laugh
6:10 - is is a very different thing and i've
6:13 - noticed playing vampire for so long now
6:15 - is
6:16 - my main rpg when i go into something
6:19 - that is more lighthearted and stuff like
6:20 - that i have a hard time making that
6:22 - switch especially the way we do it where
6:24 - we're in character most of the time and
6:25 - most tables aren't that way yeah going
6:27 - in and being like takes a minute to be
6:29 - like okay like switch that gear that bar
6:32 - has been rusted over here for a while
6:33 - now and i have to like break it over and
6:35 - like it's really interesting and that is
6:37 - so true
6:38 - so much of the perception of
6:39 - improvisation is that it's all comedy
6:42 - but my favorite improv is long-form
6:44 - narrative improv and it's you know
6:46 - improvising a story is
6:48 - fascinating and wonderful and and i feel
6:50 - like there's
6:51 - uh not a lot of that done well and
6:53 - vampire is one of the rare places you
6:55 - get to see it well partially the
6:57 - mechanics do
6:58 - encourage that it encourages that way of
7:00 - playing which is great so let's get a
7:02 - little bit a little bit deeper a little
7:03 - bit more into the subtle so that was
7:05 - your first impression let's get so with
7:07 - your characters y'all guys have a bunch
7:10 - of stuff going on
7:11 - ah so margot
7:13 - fuego which
7:15 - what's what's that about look okay um
7:18 - so i got two names what's that
7:20 - several names uh this is probably like
7:23 - my favorite little shout out to just
7:25 - being a person of color coming to the
7:26 - space where for whatever reason i don't
7:29 - know if it's like by virtue of like
7:30 - sports or just family and like friend
7:33 - stuff uh i always grew up with like a
7:35 - nickname and then you're like
7:38 - people that didn't know you well would
7:40 - call you like your government name and
7:42 - then everyone else would call you this
7:43 - like sort of other name so she
7:46 - immediately started off by saying like
7:48 - uh that was her like that was marco's
7:50 - opening volley to uh the group was you
7:53 - can call me fuego she's trying to
7:54 - establish like a friendly pattern and
7:56 - then later when she was asked what her
7:57 - name was she will she'll answer like her
7:59 - real name margo but that idea of like
8:01 - growing up with a name that like feels
8:04 - as much your real name uh as like the
8:08 - one you were like given when you were
8:09 - born maybe it is even more your real
8:11 - name yeah in a lot of ways because it's
8:13 - usually so tied to like a big strong
8:15 - emotion like you're going to yell fuego
8:17 - when you're laughing with your friends
8:18 - or when you've done something weird or
8:20 - when you get lost in club aspects and
8:22 - you have to like find your friend and go
8:23 - home already lost
8:27 - but i just wanted to like shout out that
8:29 - like little
8:30 - cultural thing
8:32 - that's awesome i like that
8:34 - um
8:35 - alex isaac is so polite
8:37 - that's like he's a public like a i don't
8:40 - know i he's like a dapper vampire man
8:42 - what's what's that about so there is a
8:44 - thing and is it and actually we were
8:46 - talking about this before the cameras
8:47 - are on and i just realized an answer to
8:48 - the question um one of my favorite
8:50 - things about vampire
8:52 - lore as as the concept of vampires
8:55 - through um
8:56 - literature and
8:57 - all forms of media
8:59 - is there is a weird tie-in to politeness
9:02 - with vampires especially going back to
9:03 - like you know they all the things that
9:05 - like
9:06 - there's a weird con
9:07 - sort of consensualness to vampires and
9:10 - the like and etiquette plays into it i
9:12 - mean there's that you know the scene in
9:14 - france coppola's dracula where you know
9:16 - jonathan harker's sitting at the table
9:17 - and he offends dracula and all of a
9:19 - sudden dracula goes from being so polite
9:20 - to immediately flying off the handle
9:22 - because there was a rejection of his you
9:24 - know etiquette and it's that's always
9:26 - something i found really interesting
9:27 - with vampire so i kind of wanted to
9:28 - explore that in isaac and that ties in
9:31 - very heavily to
9:33 - clan zamitsi have a lot of that built
9:35 - into them so that's why i wanted to play
9:37 - that clan
9:39 - um that brings us to the next level
9:42 - let's let's talk about your clans
9:44 - so you are clan tsumitsi yes
9:47 - yes
9:48 - yes
9:48 - that we have a lot of people say it
9:50 - differently they're wrong it's the
9:51 - meatsy
9:52 - um the energy i love it i okay all right
9:56 - you heard it here first you're wrong
10:00 - so it's we haven't seen a lot or maybe
10:03 - any of them any as far as i remember
10:05 - yeah yeah
10:06 - so
10:07 - so why uh zameezy's always been my
10:09 - favorite clan ever since i started
10:10 - playing vampire in um
10:13 - in high school i never got a chance to
10:14 - play one but they were always my
10:15 - favorite uh they
10:18 - were difficult to work into stories
10:21 - in older editions of vampire because it
10:23 - was their bananas um and they they do
10:26 - the earlier editions have a lot of
10:29 - there was some stuff that was like it
10:31 - just made things difficult uh so
10:33 - with the
10:34 - companion for v5 that came out that
10:36 - introduced ravnos salubri and zumitzi
10:39 - uh it's brought them into a way that is
10:41 - much
10:43 - easier to work them into a modern story
10:45 - okay
10:46 - and having them always have been my
10:48 - favorite clan i really wanted to play
10:50 - one and the reason they are my favorite
10:51 - is that they have
10:53 - as i said before a lot of times with the
10:55 - politeness and etiquette but also
10:57 - they have the duality of having that
10:59 - politeness and had to get while being
11:01 - physical monsters actual
11:04 - and in the difference that jasper was a
11:06 - physical monster because he was
11:07 - unfortunately cursed to look a certain
11:09 - way
11:10 - zamitsy are monsters because they choose
11:12 - to change their form and they choose to
11:14 - make themselves more monstrous as they
11:16 - go and learn
11:17 - and so that's something i wanted to
11:19 - explore with the
11:20 - fact that all vampires are monsters but
11:22 - there is a specific set of vampires that
11:24 - choose to make themselves the monster
11:26 - they are on the inside on the outside
11:28 - instead of being cursed to show their
11:30 - monster on the outside
11:31 - and
11:32 - i'm gonna tie this back to what you you
11:34 - said in the very beginning which was
11:35 - that when you created jasper it was
11:36 - because you're you related to something
11:39 - in that character
11:40 - um i think it's interesting the idea of
11:43 - uh a character you played before that
11:45 - was forced to be a certain way and now
11:46 - you're playing a character that creates
11:48 - how they are
11:49 - and
11:50 - so is that is that kind of an alex arc
11:52 - it might be uh
11:55 - um so vin true a clan i clearly know
11:57 - nothing about nothing nothing nothing um
12:01 - i i would love to know what drew you to
12:03 - ventrue like why that was the clan you
12:05 - wanted to dive into for your first foray
12:08 - but also um
12:11 - so well let me let me answer that first
12:13 - and then i've got to follow up okay
12:15 - follow up um i have a silly answer and a
12:16 - real answer my silly answer is uh b dave
12:19 - played a ventrue and i i mean so did you
12:21 - but i did assume that all black people
12:23 - uh were ventrue okay and vampire so uh
12:27 - that was my understanding i later found
12:29 - out that wasn't the case and chose it
12:32 - anyway no my actual answer is uh sort of
12:35 - thinking about what we use for monsters
12:38 - and like analogs and fiction for the
12:40 - thing that we are scared about at any
12:42 - given point in time uh zombies made
12:44 - sense like in the 60s when we were
12:46 - worried about like
12:47 - like it doesn't matter i don't have to
12:48 - give a big long answer but i think the
12:50 - thing that like we talk about rallying
12:52 - against and what we consider monstrous
12:53 - as people now in society are like big
12:55 - systems of power that are constantly
12:57 - like thrown against us like we talk
12:59 - about railing it's capitalism and
13:01 - billionaires and like those things that
13:03 - are just sort of insurmountable like
13:05 - bastions of power
13:06 - which is why uh when we talk about
13:09 - when you play vampire you are playing a
13:10 - monster i want to play a thing that
13:12 - resonates with me as what i consider
13:14 - monstrous which is a singular sort of
13:17 - unassailable source of power and ventrue
13:19 - appealed to me like in that right away
13:21 - and then it became fun to build a care
13:23 - like work backwards and build a
13:25 - character that would always be sort of
13:28 - balancing individual power versus like
13:31 - what her clan draws her to
13:33 - and like what her self-actualization is
13:36 - versus like what the beast is calling
13:38 - her towards and that's actually what
13:40 - drew me to the venture you actually
13:42 - segued into my follow-up question which
13:44 - is just that the venture clan is
13:47 - such a source of power and i've like
13:49 - feel like margot isn't necessarily
13:52 - um
13:54 - projecting that quite yet what's your
13:55 - what's your what is your feeling on
13:57 - where she is at with
13:59 - the the power of the ventrue and kind of
14:02 - i loved building a character that was
14:04 - locked out of her sort of birthright and
14:07 - is going to come to it the more she
14:09 - interacts with the world and finds
14:11 - herself and that that can be a story
14:13 - that's like incredibly personal it's
14:15 - also not to make everything about like
14:18 - sort of cultural things but i think that
14:20 - like resonates really hard with me as
14:21 - like a black woman in america right now
14:24 - that like feeling locked away from like
14:27 - sources of community and industry and
14:30 - like feeling like the world is sort of
14:32 - trying to keep you from being
14:34 - the truest version of yourself uh i
14:37 - think it's absolutely wonderful that
14:39 - like she begins just so deeply removed
14:41 - from all of that and will find it in her
14:44 - ways and if she like comes up and meets
14:47 - more ventrue or just other like kindred
14:50 - in general and like that arc is the
14:52 - thing i'm actually most excited about
14:54 - playing and finding that's awesome and
14:56 - that also so in delving deeper
15:00 - uh mind reading as you would um
15:03 - so in your character creation you've got
15:07 - sort of poles you've got these dramatic
15:08 - poles which i know you and i are
15:11 - familiar with um
15:13 - uh
15:14 - for those of you who abrea and i uh
15:16 - worked we did a show uh in demian's gate
15:20 - uh
15:21 - very beginning of the pandemic we were
15:22 - all locked at home and we're like you
15:23 - gotta do something and it was hill folk
15:26 - system it's very dramatic polls but um
15:28 - i'm seeing that in margot a lot and
15:30 - we're exploring especially the
15:31 - difference between how she dealt with
15:33 - richter versus the thugs
15:35 - um so in your character creation process
15:38 - was that a big uh was that very
15:40 - important to you to sort of create that
15:41 - struggle with her 100 and it's truly
15:44 - because we played that that i'm like oh
15:46 - every character now has to be built with
15:48 - this idea of like
15:49 - uh they will land in one of two very
15:52 - different but equally viable and
15:54 - interesting places so it was very easy
15:57 - for margot to like
15:59 - yeah to kind of go like does she like
16:00 - follow the party line or does she like
16:03 - fight as hard as she can to be
16:05 - this sort of self
16:06 - conception of a person
16:08 - sorry to go on one more big rant
16:11 - i'll do this forever and i'm so sorry
16:13 - because that's why we're shooters cut it
16:14 - all out
16:16 - i think it's fun that we're playing such
16:18 - young kindred because
16:21 - as people like when we were still alive
16:23 - we're so like fundamentally like
16:25 - uh
16:27 - influenced by popular culture and i i it
16:30 - was very fun building margo and
16:31 - realizing the thing that she would have
16:33 - thought of
16:34 - right after being embraced was she
16:36 - wouldn't have seen this as a curse
16:38 - we're living in the world where like the
16:40 - marvel cinematic universe is a thing
16:42 - like when you are given a certain
16:43 - bizarre gift you can use it to like
16:46 - be a hero and and elevate your community
16:49 - and save the world and i think uh it's
16:52 - so fun to have that like contextual
16:54 - understanding of a character while the
16:56 - system at every at every important
16:58 - moment reminds you like no you're a
17:00 - monster
17:01 - so it's fun to play that idea of like
17:03 - balancing what you're as a character you
17:06 - think you're capable of doing i can be a
17:07 - hero for my community for my world
17:11 - and knowing that you're always staring
17:12 - down the pipeline of like you're a
17:14 - monster and you will always end up as
17:17 - the worst version
17:18 - of what you think you are
17:21 - and that's
17:22 - like there's no way of getting out if
17:23 - you live long enough you will become the
17:25 - beast
17:26 - and it's such a beautiful space to play
17:28 - in as you're discovering who you are as
17:30 - a kindred and yeah well that's that's
17:32 - something that i love about this game in
17:34 - general is because like while like
17:36 - something like dungeons and dragons uh
17:38 - encourages you to get more powerful it
17:40 - encourages you to you start off low
17:42 - power but the solution to all your
17:43 - problems is getting more powerful this
17:46 - is not the solution to your problems is
17:47 - not getting more powerful and vampire i
17:49 - love starting off as a low as a low
17:51 - power a low powered vampire a low
17:54 - generation vampire because
17:56 - you're more closely connected to the
17:58 - world around you but also you have these
18:00 - abilities that seem insane at the time
18:02 - and then as you grow you get more and
18:04 - more abilities you get these things that
18:05 - only cause you to have more problems
18:08 - because your solutions become oh i can
18:10 - at this thing i have i can call on it to
18:12 - fix this problem and it just makes it so
18:14 - much worse and i love that very much
18:16 - about this game
18:18 - with isaac
18:20 - how much of of who that character was
18:22 - did you know before versus at the table
18:25 - who did you find at the table oh
18:27 - the thing with me
18:28 - is when i i have a hard time like i know
18:30 - who the character is i know where they
18:32 - where they uh what they what they want
18:34 - what their you know mood is how they
18:36 - feel about stuff but i never know how
18:38 - they sound until i sit down i can never
18:41 - pinpoint what the voice is for a
18:43 - character until i sit down and do it
18:47 - because i have a million ideas of what
18:49 - influence could it could be what could
18:50 - sound like this it could sound like this
18:52 - and then i open my mouth when we sit
18:53 - down the table it's always not what i
18:55 - thought it was going to be it was the
18:56 - same with your aspirin was the same with
18:57 - everything and i just
18:59 - i have to now just let that be a thing
19:01 - because i can't pinpoint it until i sit
19:02 - down at the table i had no idea isaac
19:04 - was going to sound like that until i
19:06 - opened my mouth in that first scene and
19:08 - when when you when you did sound like
19:10 - that when you found him were you like is
19:11 - that oh that's it that's what he sounds
19:13 - like
19:14 - like that was you know
19:16 - and and then from then on that
19:18 - mode of speech and the cadence and
19:20 - everything influences the character from
19:21 - where i started because i only planned a
19:24 - character up until
19:26 - the first session i know nothing about
19:28 - his future
19:29 - because that hasn't happened yet i don't
19:31 - plan for what's going to happen to a
19:32 - character i plan for i write what has
19:34 - happened because that's what i know all
19:36 - right so anything that happens from
19:38 - session one i have not planned and i've
19:41 - specifically and repeatedly asked jason
19:43 - to tell me as little as possible
19:45 - well then i suppose for our final and
19:46 - fifth level uh it's you know
19:48 - we can't go deeper because you don't you
19:50 - know you don't know where the
19:51 - character's going i don't we can't
19:53 - actually project to the characters
19:54 - feature let's let's jump out a bit to
19:56 - y'all as people
19:57 - to close it off real quick
19:59 - um
20:00 - what brought you to vampire the very
20:02 - beginning like what got you interested
20:03 - in vampire and then how excited are you
20:07 - as people at this table like exploring
20:09 - that interest you have to answer this
20:11 - first time you have to
20:12 - you have to okay um i
20:17 - i always love vampires as a kid um i we
20:20 - were talking about this before i can't
20:20 - remember exactly what my first piece of
20:23 - vampire media was
20:24 - but i always loved vampires they were
20:26 - always my favorite
20:27 - you know of the universal monsters they
20:29 - were my favorite um and i also love
20:32 - there's a lot i love about vampires um
20:33 - what draws me to vampires specifically
20:35 - is the idea that vampires are the
20:37 - ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing
20:39 - they're they're they are
20:41 - this thing that looks human and is
20:42 - literally the farthest thing from human
20:44 - uh that it appeals to me it i think it
20:47 - creates interesting stories and i also
20:49 - love that they are a malleable thing and
20:51 - it is it is
20:53 - it is it is the exact there isn't so
20:55 - many examples of it in the world of
20:57 - darkness and the vampires are so
20:58 - different that all the clans are
20:59 - different they all have different
21:00 - abilities but it's also
21:02 - showcased in the legends of vampires
21:04 - from around the world every culture has
21:06 - a
21:07 - radically different idea of what a
21:09 - vampire is
21:10 - there's so many different examples of
21:12 - just crazy things that are just this is
21:13 - what our vampire is this is what this is
21:15 - this is what there's so many different
21:16 - and i love that that it is a creature
21:18 - that is in so many different cultures is
21:20 - wildly different from each other
21:22 - and that is a rarity among you know the
21:24 - monsters of our imaginations is that
21:26 - they are so wildly different you know
