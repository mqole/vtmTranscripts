### WIP- current captions directly ripped from youtube.

0:00 - hello good evening and welcome to our vampire the masquerade chronicle new york by
0:08 - night tonight we continue our story of a fledgling coterie of anarch vampires
0:15 - struggling to find their place in undead society in the bronx borough of new york city
0:21 - with season one episode four like a graveyard
0:27 - we'll find out if the title is prophetic or not
0:33 - let's meet our graveyard vampires i'm alex ford and i'm playing isaac a
0:41 - cheery zamitsy i'm miana baron i'm playing serif the mischievous ravnos
0:47 - i'm abria eingar playing fuego the spicy ventrue i'm joey rasul i'm playing ray the
0:54 - business-minded gang girl welcome vampires
1:00 - i'm jason carl your storyteller i'd like to thank a few people for
1:06 - making tonight possible we'd like to thank blackmagic designs for the cameras that are bringing us to
1:12 - you in unliving color tonight we want to thank renegade game studios for making sure that we have all the
1:18 - hunger dice we could possibly ever need and we'd like to thank dogmite games for
1:25 - the beautiful storyteller screen
1:31 - a prologue we have talked about the
1:37 - blood rich layer cake that is unlife after dark
1:42 - we've talked about that lowest tier of the cake first now the second middle tier of the bloody
1:49 - cake is higher up and it's smaller fewer bites to go around
1:56 - for the vampires who occupy that layer the vampires of this stratum look down
2:04 - on those upon whom they stand the younger less knowledgeable but the more numerous licks
2:13 - the vampires in the middle tier have a have a better view from here
2:18 - now the vampires at the first tier are at the ground level they see the oil choked puddles they see the vacant
2:25 - storefronts they see the cars and the people on the street
2:31 - you know for them it's all darkness and fog and sickly orange sodium arc light
2:38 - street lights but the kindred at the second tier can see out a little further
2:44 - they sit above the dance floor looking down at the throng below
2:50 - in a way they sit above the city and from their penthouses and rooftops those street lights start to look like
2:58 - twinkling little stars the view is deceptive from up here
3:04 - the shadow above them the top layer of the cake is small so
3:09 - maybe they think they're alone here maybe think they're on top of the world
3:16 - they're not with this firmly in mind
3:22 - let's tell a vampire story [Music]
3:34 - [Music]
4:07 - so
4:13 - [Music]
4:25 - [Music]
4:39 - [Music]
4:50 - have you ever just wandered a city on foot with maybe a couple of
4:57 - bus or subway rides thrown in for good measure have you ever done it after dark
5:05 - when the street lights are on but it's still hard to see detail more than a few feet in front of you
5:13 - new york city can be huge daunting it offers a tangle of streets and alleys
5:20 - and dead ends a melange of confounding smells car exhaust perfume
5:27 - food garbage and a tapestry of shadows
5:33 - to a vampire wandering new york city the streets are often a hunting ground
5:40 - they are hunting and yet they are also being hunted
5:46 - every cross street is new territory and make no mistake the city is divided up
5:52 - into cruel little fiefdoms and domains the same way that human gangs mark out
5:58 - turf and protect it vampires do the same they scratch out hunting grounds and
6:03 - they don't take well to poachers our coterie is newly formed
6:09 - and its vampires are young so they're very much working in the present in new york city
6:15 - it's an irony i guess considering their evidently immortal state but it does mean that what happens
6:23 - tonight is important what happens on the city block is
6:28 - important what happens when they need to get fed or get paid
6:36 - longer term plans may come sooner or later because who knows
6:42 - what else is out there in the night too many variables wait in those long
6:47 - shadows tonight
6:53 - six evenings have passed since our codery encountered annabelle a bruja from los angeles
7:00 - who accidentally found her way into their territory let's find out
7:07 - what our coterie has been doing in the intervening evenings
7:14 - ray it's been six nights how have you spent the time what have you done who
7:20 - have you seen one of the main things that i've been doing is convincing drexler
7:27 - who owns the gotham cab company on our turf to
7:32 - make me financial advisor seeing as the benefit is now that he
7:38 - doesn't have to deal with richter he deals with us and we deal with richter on his behalf
7:44 - him being in our territory which means that if he
7:51 - wants me to be uh somewhat presentable he needs to keep me
7:58 - very happy because i only have so much composure and i'm now speaking on his behalf
8:05 - now when you say financial advisor i hear air quotes around the
8:10 - word the new arrangement is that there's about a dozen cabs on his register that
8:16 - don't actually exist they take payments only in cash and those cash payments come from me
8:24 - and that money that is made by the company is my salary
8:30 - our salary are you laundering money right i don't know what you mean
8:37 - remember how well that worked out last time all it takes is a couple people paying attention to what's going on to make it
8:44 - run smoothly if you want to make it a party we can throw a party and not launder
8:50 - money at the same time but i don't need to explain that to richter right now does drexler know what you're doing
8:58 - drexel is aware does he get a cut is he in on it drexler doesn't have to deal with
9:04 - richter anymore which means that he might keep all of his limbs this time
9:11 - you've spent time then at the taxi dispatch with drexler
9:17 - in the process of uh bringing your scheme into being
9:22 - i'll mention that drexler knows quite a bit about the neighborhood he's been in port morris for
9:29 - at least a year and he knows its streets he knows some of its people
9:35 - and he hears a lot of things however you learn that he is not in fact of clan
9:40 - nosferatu at all he is in fact a catif
9:46 - one of the clanless no blood claims him and he claims no
9:51 - blood that is information that i will have
9:57 - shared with the coterie okay thank you ray is there anything else that i should know before we begin
10:03 - tonight the only other thing is that over this week rey has been a bit distant from fuego
10:12 - distant physically as in they has made a point to not be in her presence or distant
10:19 - socially minimal interaction minimal interaction interesting all right
10:25 - we'll explore that in a bit well that's a good time to ask fuego i
10:31 - guess what you've been doing in the last six nights or so the sort of last three days
10:39 - nights of her life have been the most where she's been connected to
10:45 - her kindred life she has a coterie now and more information in context and connections than she ever did before and
10:52 - i think she's having a strong reaction to that and is kind of flinging herself back into her human life she's going to
10:59 - go check in with her mom and all of the people of like the neighborhood council
11:06 - and even mateo maybe mateo well
11:13 - let's take those interactions one at a time shall we okay okay carol walker
11:19 - is your mortal mother who still lives here in the bronx
11:26 - whenever you check in on her it's always joyfully chaotic whether
11:31 - your phone whether you're calling her on the phone the mobile phone which she
11:37 - doesn't like to use but picks up whenever you call she still hasn't mastered text messages
11:43 - thank god and the internet for her is something that happens to other people
11:49 - or whether you visit in person the house always seems to be full of people some of whom you are related to
11:57 - by family by blood and some whom you simply claim as family just because they're so
12:03 - familiar to you and you've known them too long so long is this a phone call or a personal visit oh this is definitely
12:09 - in person this is definitely in person are you expected or is it a surprise visit uh
12:15 - look i tried to send her a text i know she didn't get it so it's gonna be a surprise but i did try to warn her
12:22 - it's fine she's overjoyed to see you the only other thing i want to ask is
12:28 - before you walk in the house bless your life flush of life i don't think she's
12:35 - gotten into the habit of not having it up like for these six days it's just second nature

12:48 - you check for her hunger growth a success success you do

24:28 - isaac's every night and helping him gusty up the place a bit gussy up the place
24:34 - took some of the tarps down off the first floor dusted a bunch of stuff started to hang some of the art
24:39 - his sculpture that he showed me i wanted to get it in a nice little spot so people could see it and admire it

24:52 - a room for yourself there yeah i don't use it but it's mine can you tell us about the
24:57 - mural it takes about half of the room split down the middle black and white
25:04 - the white side is thick drawn feathers with a couple black feathers spread
25:10 - throughout and two red gothic a's one for argus one for my mother alicia
25:16 - the black side is um the first initials of my coteries name
25:22 - and in the center is a gothic s split with the opposite color of whatever the wall is
25:28 - and behind it is a strange sun-esque symbol that i think about
25:34 - sometimes but i am not aware is my clan symbol sun-like
25:41 - with rays of light or maybe spokes of a wheel
25:46 - yeah okay
25:54 - how does isaac feel about this what do you think ah
25:59 - well it's different good different
26:04 - what specifically am i looking at well it's are we in your room or are we
26:10 - downstairs uh it's uh it's the mural it's my room it's interesting
26:15 - after the last few nights i'm going to take a look at this and say considering your comings and goings
26:30 - that's what that is that's what you are i don't know what that is oh i just mean you've been leaving you haven't been
26:36 - staying here i don't know where you've been staying considering that and the uh
26:41 - rat you showed me i'm going to save ravnos
26:48 - interesting is that good no idea okay it's not common like i'm
26:53 - not common but i don't think has the same negative connotations that my clan has
26:58 - um but they you are one of the 13 so
27:05 - and the first floor what do you oh and i take him downstairs lovely it's nice i appreciate it
27:13 - i don't have an eye for interior design so i appreciate someone else's input

27:44 - it's not it's not what i expected sir how so have you seen it
27:50 - no it's uh i don't know how to tell you this
27:58 - it's kind of like a minivan makes a logical sense to fit that many people um
28:06 - i assume the interior workings are up to their normal standards oh yeah it's i mean for a minivan but
28:13 - it's still a minivan oh he can't always be stylish maybe somebody should you know
28:18 - take a look at it i don't know we can take a look at it are the others coming over tonight
28:25 - as far as i know yes i'll tell angela wonderful she's been out
28:32 - trying to find out what you can about your monster you know and i'm sure she'll find something i think she's ready to
28:39 - report in wonderful yeah great um over these
28:44 - last couple days uh other than getting the car isaac has been assisting
28:53 - as much is physically necessary in the redecoration of his building
28:59 - has been spending time in his room away from the other comings and goings they are allowed to enter and leave
29:05 - when they want but as long as they don't uh as long as i know they're there when they're there
29:10 - but i also sent michael to check up on both sarah
29:16 - and marcus just to know that they're still alive
29:22 - and safe
29:32 - angela and michael confirmed that both sarah and marcus
29:38 - are safe they're in good health great they are not behaving in any way out of
29:44 - the ordinary wonderful i that's all i need to know also um i
29:50 - would have at one point or another gone to see uh drexler as well personally
29:55 - personally what was that visit about that was after i copied all the
30:00 - information off of all the disks and made copies of all the papers inside
30:06 - of the briefcase and then return the briefcase to him where did you find a machine that could
30:11 - read those antiques assume i found a definitely found an
30:17 - old pc that has a disk drive attached to it to copy the having a a reader and writer disk drive to be
30:23 - able to copy those i could not copy the floppy disk
30:29 - yes and i think that the place you found these was that gray market electronics store i mentioned that is in the
30:34 - neighborhood absolutely so i think you would find that you would need help yes
30:42 - so i will sings return the briefcase sans floppy disk anything i couldn't copy i kept
30:48 - and i will make a point to return it to him as a peace offering due to the fact that we are now
30:54 - in charge wonderful
31:00 - thanks you're welcome i thought you would want these back i mean yeah i do
31:07 - what is shreknit he gestures and you can see that his
31:13 - left hand his hand the one that you removed is
31:19 - in the process of still growing back the fingers aren't quite
31:24 - at full size yet very strange
31:30 - ah other than being a sort of kindred internet
31:36 - he does a uh a movie style look around to make sure that no one is
31:42 - overhearing uh it's funny you know i talked to you i've been
31:48 - talking to your buddy ray hmm yeah we're kind of in business together good yeah
31:53 - yeah you could say we're partners all right yeah we're partners uh
32:00 - you know he got some issues yes yeah okay um treknap well i mean if you must
32:06 - know it i mean it isn't i mean it ain't anymore right
32:13 - it's gone it was yeah it was a kind of um you know it was kind of like a internet
32:20 - felix right kind of a kind of a
32:25 - vampire web if it does not exist why is this so important
32:31 - well as i understand it shrek net was built and maintained by
32:38 - the nosferatu of new york city and uh it got uh taken
32:43 - out you know hacked right yeah uh but not by vampires ah yeah right
32:51 - interesting yeah so um maybe by the government
32:57 - and that led to a lot of problems for the camarilla i can imagine yeah
33:02 - problems that probably ain't still gone yes so there are some nosferatu who would
33:09 - very much like to get their hands on some of the pieces of it the code and whatnot
33:16 - so and that's some of it uh that's what i'm told i made a deal with the uh the putin esca
33:24 - and uh the problem was i couldn't come up with a scratch in time to pay him off right and that's when we all got acquainted me
33:32 - and you and your friends are you still in danger of being
33:38 - i i don't know well i mean they didn't get what they wanted
33:45 - i ain't heard from him well considering you are now under our protection as it were you know who to
33:52 - call if they should bother you again i mean those were just you know goons
33:57 - those were just thugs you really want to tangle with hikara not particularly but we do have duties
34:03 - now being in charge of this area do your friends know you're telling me this
34:09 - no awesome okay i accept the bargain
34:16 - great this is great i'm glad you're pleased yeah uh anyway um
34:22 - i guess uh i'll contact the guy who wanted to buy these and see if he still wants them
34:27 - great do i have to let you know if you sell them
34:32 - yeah not as long as rey is in knowledge of the financial transaction
34:39 - that happens i mean what if i ain't selling it to anox ah interesting who would you be selling
34:46 - it to i mean there are some questions i don't want to know the answer to so i don't ask them
34:53 - that's very interesting yeah i don't particularly have a problem with it going anywhere else i
34:58 - don't see the trouble but just remember that i have made copies of everything that is in there what yes
35:06 - so if i find that same information somewhere else in the hands of someone particularly not friendly to us then i
35:12 - know who and where they got it from i knew this was too good to be true
35:17 - all right message received wonderful enjoy your evening yeah you too
35:23 - god i hate this town
35:33 - arriving in your own vehicles i assume or through your own methods
35:40 - you eventually all find your way back to isaac's
35:45 - that dilapidated brownstone on the east river show
35:50 - sure could be a show too hmm
35:58 - please come in everyone hi hi hello oh it looks so nice thank you so much
36:03 - you've done such a good job has done a very nice job um so just to put it out there i have been uh
36:11 - less than forthcoming with knowledge concerning uh you all in my observations
36:16 - of who you are and what you do and i will be less so in the future just to
36:21 - was an effort to protect my own uh being as we had just met each other
36:26 - but as far as when you ask me questions about things that you don't know i will be more forthcoming with knowledge that
36:32 - i know this is include access to the third floor no okay gotta shoot your shot yeah
36:40 - thank you you're welcome does that include information about what was in that uh
36:47 - briefcase yes it is um a piece of what was once shrek net as we
36:53 - heard as in the codes and or at least some of them the codes to how to
36:59 - get it to work as it were as far as i am to understand uh it is no longer a thing but
37:05 - some people are interested in what it was and to own a piece of it
37:10 - well like a collector or like uh build it back better
37:16 - possibly both or either
37:21 - but i have made copies of everything and anything i couldn't copy i have kept i
37:26 - returned the rest of it to drexler he will do with it as he wishes but
37:32 - if it comes to any harm to us or ours we will know where they got it from
37:38 - love it good thinking now
37:44 - just so we're all on the same page and we all have a baseline information about each other samitsi ravnos ventrue
37:49 - gangrel okay what those are the commands that was a bunch of words that i don't
37:54 - understand the clans i was speaking of earlier you are a gangrel you are avengers you are ravenous i am zamitsy
38:01 - how the [ __ ] do you know that by observing every clan has things they can and can't
38:06 - do and has personalities that are attracted when they are turned
38:12 - certain people get turned into certain things as a general rule this feels like astrology okay do me why
38:19 - am i a ventrue you like power you will gravitate towards power you want you can stop
38:24 - right there anyway i'm weird you already knows you
38:31 - travel you like adventure daredevil tell stories make art wow
38:38 - you are different you aren't you shouldn't have been gagging you should have been ventrue
38:43 - but you're a gangrel and that is at odds
38:49 - great how'd that happen it can't be changed so enjoy what you have
38:57 - do you really want to know how'd it happen i mean
39:06 - picture getting mugged in an alley okay in a way that doesn't really
39:13 - end all that well um i
39:19 - went back to my penthouse in uh manhattan penthouse
39:24 - and to suit okay you know tried to uh
39:31 - figure out what was going on with me trying to figure out what uh
39:36 - what change was coming over me why i couldn't stay awake during the day why i felt
39:43 - compelled to keep the windows closed why i didn't want to see anyone why i was
39:50 - craving blood as all of you i assume went through as well yes
39:55 - yeah but as you pointed out it is good to have someone
40:01 - to show you the ropes and with no one there
40:12 - let's just say that the shreknet type information would have been uh what
40:17 - would have made the transition easier i think that would have happened ah that's right on the
40:24 - subject of that um the reason it does not exist anymore is because it was discovered by
40:32 - mortals possibly the government uh
40:37 - my guess is that humans are not looking for things that
40:44 - they don't believe exist i don't believe anyone believed a
40:49 - kindred internet existed i believe a kindred let it slip in an effort to take
40:55 - down other kindred which is something we all want to do
41:00 - makes sense they overplayed their hand the government found out about it and now it doesn't exist
41:08 - and i'm sure a lot of kindred died because of it that's just my guess
41:18 - okay while you're guessing yes as we're learning about all these
41:24 - factions anarch camarilla sabbat yes
41:30 - where do you think that uh leak came from
41:36 - i would say probably camarilla makes sense sabbats don't care
41:42 - to use it want to destroy they want to
41:48 - bleed everything they're the closest of us to just being rampaging murder machines as you can get
41:56 - a few of them as far as i'm aware deal in uh subtle plots and intrigue
42:03 - direct approach is better this was a lot more fun before this information right
42:08 - yeah yeah but it lets us know who we're dealing with yeah the camarilla
42:14 - will i don't know if i buy the organized ones
42:20 - destroyed a method of communication ooh but camarilla all but outlaw phones
42:26 - yeah why not information only destroys the ability to shore up
42:31 - and secure your own power you control it yes the first thing and uh user does is
42:38 - remove your ability to contact other people to keep you in the dark is the easiest
42:44 - way to control someone and the organization to withstand
42:50 - whatever humans would throw at them anox wouldn't do that
42:56 - just a bunch of chocolate [ __ ] running around yeah and our streets however um
43:04 - what's the word i'm looking for however uh dangerous it may be they would prefer
43:09 - their freedoms over the simplicity of hardline rules yeah
43:15 - which is why annabelle wants so desperately to take them down understood yeah she did strike me as a kind of
43:24 - burn everything down regardless of uh who it hurts yes i'm very curious as to what went down type situation oh oh oh
43:30 - okay what was she could you tell bruha what's that built for revolution always
43:37 - rebelling burn everything down okay fight the power eat the rich those kind of things you learned all this from your
43:43 - side yes and observations of other kindred remember i've been around for a number of years longer than you that's fair
43:50 - okay i've met other kindred in my short time being around interesting
43:57 - well thank you you're welcome yes have you ever met anybody else like me no no
44:02 - okay you're the first one which is why i didn't immediately know what you were okay
44:08 - have met benjamin have met gangrel what are we common yeah that's just
44:17 - the kind of people that society builds and the desires of most people in
44:24 - a modern society lend themselves to venture people want corporate power
44:32 - whether for good or ill intentions
44:37 - okay great so now that we're all on the same page
44:44 - anybody hear anything about the monster no but i wanted to know if anybody had heard anything else look it's gotten
44:51 - farther up down my mom had heard about it hadn't seen anything she's fine interesting
44:56 - but yeah i'm very curious so you think it's one of those cryptid out here let's go right do we
45:02 - have a chupacabra on our hands we holy [ __ ] if we exit nah it's fine
45:08 - i'm not worried other things exist i'm sir do you want angela's report now i would
45:13 - love that that'd be wonderful michael excuses himself he nods at fuego before he does
45:21 - he's been out of the room for perhaps a minute when angela steps in she's stressed as she's angela steps in
45:28 - uh ray stands up and doesn't sit down until she sets as well
45:35 - she remains standing unless isaac invites her to set
45:41 - please sit down angela sir if you want to
45:47 - i'm comfortable and remain standing as well okay whatever
45:53 - she takes a seat awkwardly as though she's not accustomed to sitting here
45:58 - you don't sit on the first floor often i mean
46:04 - never before but you live here yes i do
46:09 - ah we don't spend time on the first floor often or didn't at least there wasn't a reason to it was only the three
46:15 - of us i have to admit okay i like it thank you
46:25 - i always wondered what was in that painting case
46:30 - yes sir she removes a small notepad
46:36 - from her pocket well you asked me to uh
46:43 - take a look around yes talk to people find out about this
46:49 - monster this creature well
46:54 - there are a lot of rumors it's very difficult to run down exactly what is true and what is not
47:00 - the reports are conflicting but there are some similarities that i've noted in talking to different people in
47:07 - the neighborhood whatever it is is incredibly fast and very strong
47:14 - it is probably kindred but i have no idea who or what clan it might be
47:22 - it is possible that it is something else as you know sir there are other
47:27 - creatures yes a lupine is a possibility oh yes a
47:36 - werewolf this [ __ ] a werewolf you weren't kidding when you said other things were real oh my god i wasn't um werewolves
47:43 - are above our paygrade seriously yes those films where vampires
47:49 - fight werewolves are wildly inaccurate oh [ __ ] we lose normally yes oh almost
47:54 - exclusively seriously yes well even four at four to one four and
48:01 - half to one they can tear you in half and
48:06 - i took the liberty sir of uh special ordering silver ammunition just in case that would be
48:11 - i don't know if the folklore is true but neither do i but it's a lovely idea you know next time you're buying bullets can
48:17 - i get some 22 rounds i didn't know i had to like be strapped against weird dogs and if you have any extra i like to make
48:23 - jewelry out of them now angela looks at your necklace is that the um
48:29 - yeah ah i see that you've uh set it in the casing sure did i know a guy
48:35 - incredible um my functions are not limitless so buying going ammunition is probably a
48:40 - good idea okay okay uh i'm would be happy to uh arrange it
48:47 - as as suggested although are you sure you want something so small as a 22. okay
48:55 - like it's not about the size it's discreet actually yeah can i have a better gun
49:02 - sir sure i have money we can talk we don't have to you don't have to ask out isaac after you're at your convenience
49:09 - i recommend something in the uh in the nine millimeter family okay
49:14 - um but to continue um it's been seen most often
49:23 - around the underpasses as you know there are several highways that
49:29 - bisect and encircle the neighborhood 278 the major deegan and the bruckner
49:35 - it seems to lurk in those places most often i suggested
49:40 - is because it can find prey there as you know people often congregate in those places for shelter and for warmth right
49:48 - but it has struck randomly in the neighborhood as well interesting
49:54 - it does not seem to have a a flight pattern right so i am uncertain
50:00 - how to suggest how we go about finding it you might simply get lucky or
50:06 - it might be wise to use some bait yes it does
50:11 - more than kill how so the victims are
50:18 - partly eaten sir oh they are torn apart hence my suggestion that it could be one of the
50:26 - lupines that uh mr voklop i mean that had been mentioned right who's club
50:35 - ah they are looks at the floor nice higher
50:40 - oh okay
50:45 - so interesting also um there has been
50:51 - increased police activity in the neighborhood great um there was a body found in an alley
50:57 - not too far from this resident sir about a week ago a real estate developer looks like he
51:04 - was it was probably one of us okay
51:10 - and um sloppy there is a uh a journalist knocking on doors and talking to people
51:15 - trying to find out about the uh the death okay so there's some additional
51:22 - attention here all right good to know come clean all right that might be a little bit my
51:27 - fault uh huh so sorry well
51:33 - actually i think that one i think the blame with that one lies with me
51:38 - but which one is in time it's both oh this would be when you stormed out of
51:45 - the house the first night you were here yeah and came back a little less hungry
51:51 - right and a lot more calm well if you do intend to feed like that
51:58 - which i how you feed is your business um i would suggest hiding the body
52:04 - next time we'll be neater in future yeah sorry oh don't apologize to me
52:12 - [ __ ] sean bad things will happen to you okay sir if the police should canvas the
52:18 - build the neighborhood and knock i take it in the daytime we are not at home we are not at home we're not at
52:25 - home and the journalist should he go away doesn't need to not unless fine we get
52:33 - where they found something out that could expose us but i find that highly unlikely very well
52:39 - i think making doing nothing is the best option in this if we do something
52:45 - we get closer connected to it to return to the monster final piece of information i can share
52:51 - is that each of its victims have been apparently alone it does not
52:57 - attack groups interesting so as i say some sort of lure or bait
53:03 - might be in order i volunteer that was so quick
53:11 - well we can discuss it it's easy to see from angela's expression that she is
53:17 - surprised and relieved she assumed she would be the bait
53:24 - what did you say her clan was like ravenous
53:30 - ravenos oh uh illusions and daredevil activities that's
53:36 - that's the one i was thinking about and you want to be bait for a werewolf
53:41 - yeah okay you don't think that's why are you mad it seems like i'm just
53:47 - saying you don't think that that's the the beast talking
53:52 - maybe it is so you don't have to fight it all the time
53:58 - you guys fight it well
54:05 - yeah not a not all of us are as lucky as you okay calm down this is
54:11 - me calm as calm as i get these days anyway
54:16 - so hangs out under bridges eats people when they're alone bait seems like the quickest way to find
54:23 - it otherwise we're going to spend a number of nights trying to canvas the area looking to get the drop on it but setting a trap is probably the best way
54:31 - didn't you say this thing was out of our pay grade why are we if it is a dubai if it is not we might be able to deal
54:37 - with it if it is we just serifs just [ __ ] yes and then we three of us run
54:43 - oh i thought we would investigate if if what if a werewolf attacks you i'll have all the information i need
54:50 - hmm i think i could probably get away what
54:57 - [ __ ] are you fast the only one who no not even that
55:02 - there is rumors that some kindred of much higher older kindred
55:09 - have beaten werewolves loopholes but we are not that old or powerful
55:16 - okay but possibly bait that's not one of us
55:22 - and then observing what happens is the best way because i would prefer uh
55:29 - that that didn't happen to any of us would make things complicated
55:36 - okay you can see from angela's expression that this is about what she expected
55:43 - i would also prefer it'd not be one of my people but
55:51 - i could this is where it gets
55:56 - muddy in that it requires the possibility of sacrificing
56:01 - a person oh so how do we want to handle that
56:09 - well look our numbers aren't very strong for dealing with the problems that we have
56:14 - with day-to-day life i don't think we should go sacrificing someone for
56:20 - a monster problem that's not outside of our purview but
56:26 - on the fringes well then the other option is to just
56:31 - go and investigate and see if we can find and catch it i will of course do it sir i know
56:37 - i prefer to not lose you i would prefer not to be lost but it might be the easiest way okay we're not
56:44 - worried about hard i think do we have a stock of the other kindred that are here
56:50 - maybe they don't have to pay their rent to richter and we we cover them for a month if they
56:56 - do us a solid well that's possible if we find anyone that's a little behind
57:04 - you know the way i see it and this is the way i would like to
57:11 - keep richter at bay no one in this territory is paying rent
57:16 - anymore except for us because we are in charge of this territory
57:22 - he put us in charge because he didn't want to have to deal with what's going on here
57:28 - and as long as we speak for the territory we have a little bit of power
57:34 - if we let people continue to go to richter directly and let richter go to them directly still
57:42 - were expendable so we are de facto becoming a micro
57:48 - bearing as if we're oh yes i think the term sir that you're looking for is
57:53 - landlords yes oh i don't like that oof that is micro barons that fits um
58:01 - it wasn't part of your instructions sir but it's possible that michael and i could start some kind of census
58:06 - i mean we cannot detect kindred
58:12 - certainly not easily but i believe if you [Music] angela
58:18 - try hard enough you can at least tell their feelings towards you specifically
58:25 - yes i can sir and that will give you a good idea
58:31 - census it is yes why her specifically it's something i can do
58:37 - oh i didn't explain i'm sorry i forgot uh angela and michael are my ghouls
58:42 - the [ __ ] are cool um they
58:47 - work for me they're your slaves no not even remotely yes they are
58:53 - how so because they can't say no yes they can
58:58 - try prove it to me yeah tell angela do a cartwheel
59:04 - if i tell andrija to do a cartwheel she will do a cartwheel yeah but they had the option oh my god
59:10 - you're saying no it's true i did i could have said no i prefer this but not anymore
59:17 - i don't know have you tried i have never found any reason to
59:23 - why would i i don't put them in any i assure you miss serif the life i lead
59:28 - tonight is far better in my view than the life i had
59:34 - i would do to be for you i would do it again hmm sarah few good
59:39 - i'm sorry i didn't mean to upset you it's fine you didn't my mom's that way ah oh [ __ ] oh
59:49 - that's well you're a kindred can you like undo it only yeah how do you
59:55 - make a ghoul you give them a little bit of your blood every month oh and it
1:00:01 - extends it makes them a little tougher gives them a little bit of your power and uh keeps them from aging is that
1:00:06 - just a your clan thing or an every plan thing my understanding
1:00:14 - understanding mr malcolm is that any kindred can do this and the procedure
1:00:20 - is quite simple it allows me to have someone to watch my
1:00:26 - back during the day and they get benefits on the other side
1:00:32 - but not so much in the agency department no if you're looking at that directly then no
1:00:39 - it's common practice amongst most kindred he's good to you
1:00:45 - i mean i'm not sure in what context you mean i want for nothing
1:00:51 - i feel like i perform a valuable service i feel like i do what i'm supposed to be
1:00:57 - doing and i if i do say so myself miss serif i am good at it
1:01:04 - my my life seems to have far more meaning for me now than before i cannot
1:01:11 - tell you truthfully that all employees of all kindred feel similarly
1:01:17 - but i certainly do they were the closest to me when i got turned uh when i i was part
1:01:25 - of the midnighters technically still am they were my closest companions in there and when i found out how to do this i
1:01:32 - asked them if they wanted it and they both said yes i see
1:01:38 - angela it's kind of sweet sure you've talked about
1:01:43 - doing stuff during the day of course she's human
1:01:49 - um yeah i just thought of i hadn't i like dwight realized more than that but
1:01:55 - you are i'm i'm still what i think you would call immortal sir
1:02:02 - i can go out in the day and i do i eat i drink i sleep
1:02:08 - i do all the things that you did before but i carry with me at all times
1:02:16 - a sliver of my employer's power i don't know if it is the same for each
1:02:23 - of us but in my particular case when i concentrate on an individual
1:02:30 - i can tell if they mean me harm i can tell if they're one of you
1:02:36 - or something else it's very convenient michael has different gifts than myself
1:02:44 - which is fascinating my understanding is that the thin bloods
1:02:50 - are closer to us than to you yes they stand somewhere between what we are
1:02:56 - and what you are and i'm told
1:03:02 - because you know we employees talk i'm told that some of the thin bloods can even
1:03:08 - like us go out in the day and yet they are still kindred yes i would
1:03:14 - if i was being generous and in
1:03:19 - liberal company i would say they are the 14th clan
1:03:25 - okay okay but most kindred would not like to hear that spoken most kindred do not like the thin bloods
1:03:31 - because they can or at least some go out in the day do these things and there's archaic thinking that it's going to
1:03:37 - bring about some sort of apocalypse or something i don't know anything about that i do know however that they can do some
1:03:44 - amazing things yes oh yes thank you angela ah annabelle said uh she
1:03:49 - mentioned the thin blitz when we were talking to her she said they can do some sort of sorcery that is in fact wrong
1:03:56 - yeah they can do something it is not sorcery it is more akin to chemistry and alchemy
1:04:01 - no they are using a science to [Music] interact with blood to make things
1:04:08 - happen i don't know how it works it's very fascinating though i've only seen it twice
1:04:15 - once the thin blood that i was working with drank something from a hip flask
1:04:23 - and i know it sounds incredible but he
1:04:28 - levitated off the ground to reach a high window dead and another doesn't
1:04:35 - sound like chemistry to me i in another i'm not exactly sure how
1:04:42 - she was able to do it but she used some of her blood and she mixed it with paint oil paint
1:04:50 - and then using a brush she painted um
1:04:55 - designs i think you would say geometric shapes and they took on very strange qualities that i really didn't
1:05:01 - understand who was that unfortunately that particular thin blood is is no longer with us they are um
1:05:09 - a lot more vulnerable to things than we are as being closer to mortals but she calls
1:05:15 - it alchemy yes i don't know if you if you if you know a thin blood perhaps they can explain uh
1:05:22 - as far as i'm aware this may not be the truth or even remotely correct but as far as i'm aware
1:05:27 - it's something only they can do the alchemy i have no idea perhaps it can be taught
1:05:34 - like all as i'm told most other powers can be taught my
1:05:39 - understanding is that exactly if i'm wrong sir i've tried hard
1:05:44 - to to listen to this to the lessons you're doing great
1:05:50 - each clan each family of the kindred possesses
1:05:55 - certain affinities disciplines disciplines
1:06:01 - affinities for various powers and that's one way you can sometimes
1:06:07 - distinguish a clan but if i understand correctly sir any
1:06:13 - kindred can learn any power even if it isn't part of
1:06:20 - your clan yes you just need a little bit of the other clan's blood i'm look i'm just trying to get an understanding of
1:06:27 - the pieces that are on the board there's a lot and we haven't even covered half of them should i have michael
1:06:33 - bring the car sir i think it sounds like we have a hunt yes we do
1:06:40 - very are you happy one more thing am i what are you happy
1:06:46 - am i happy [Music]
1:06:53 - i'm sorry i'm not sure anyone has asked me that in a long time i'm asking you right now am i happy
1:07:01 - i am content okay may i think about it you may
1:07:07 - but that's i would not need to give you permission you could have as much time as you want to answer that question
1:07:14 - i'll tell michael sir thank you yes
1:07:20 - what's a k-diff hmm um kind of exists outside of the
1:07:27 - traditional clans a cadif through some um
1:07:35 - malfunction of the process of turning a mortal to a kindred
1:07:41 - they have no connection to any clan so they just exist as a kindred full kindred but have no lineage have no
1:07:49 - specific affinities so they just kind of pick up whatever
1:07:54 - they learn that's uh but you can learn anything
1:07:59 - in having conversations with drexler he mentioned being
1:08:05 - fascinating michael informs you that the car is ready
1:08:11 - and so this seems like an appropriate time to pause our vampire story for now
1:08:36 - hey everyone i'm yev uh here from new york city now uh victor sent me out here to do some tech work for a friend of his
1:08:42 - i haven't quite met up with them yet but uh but either way very exciting to be sent on location uh now back to the
1:08:48 - blazing uh big apple as they call it lots of fun things about the uh the big apple uh it's got it's got apples uh
1:08:54 - they're huge uh the nice thing about it is i tend to retain my memory out here back on the
1:09:00 - west coast uh i would lose entire days uh which was super strange uh and and very weird uh
1:09:07 - but victor never seemed to be bothered by that in my my memory lapses so that was good uh didn't affect my employment
1:09:13 - uh which is great uh love everything about it uh i guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the big apple uh
1:09:20 - i'm i'm helping some of his friends or at least i'm supposed to be hopefully soon when they reach out but
1:09:26 - i wanted to to tell you uh the same thing that i'm going to tell them which is
1:09:32 - if you go to backblaze.com ny by night that's n-y-b-y-n-i-g-h-t
1:09:38 - you can start a free trial of backblaze we'll back up everything on your computer some movies photos music videos

1:17:32 - welcome back to our vampire the masquerade chronicle new york by night
1:17:38 - season one episode four like a graveyard
1:17:46 - but we're not in a graveyard at least not yet
1:17:52 - we're in the south bronx in the neighborhood of port morris
1:17:57 - and we're hunting a monster yes
1:18:02 - michael seems a little bit unsure of the new vehicle and as serif already overheard
1:18:10 - it is in fact a mini van it's more of a combination minivan suv
1:18:16 - it's a soccer mom car look it fits that's right our intended purposes
1:18:22 - i like it it's like a bear cat or a hell cat or anything it's a durango with
1:18:28 - a hellcat engine i don't know what that means i don't either sounds important i think i know about cars i may be part of
1:18:34 - that gang but the cars were never my thing i just can get one all aboard as long as it's got enough
1:18:40 - space it does have enough space it's comfortable and as soon as michael starts the engine
1:18:46 - it's clear that it is a powerful machine not your average minivan this thing's
1:18:52 - got a lot of horsepower under the hood even if it doesn't look spectacularly elegant and you know the
1:18:57 - weird thing i was told this is how they sell them we didn't mess with this isaac this this engine does feel like
1:19:03 - you're compensating a little bit well they i just asked for a powerful car that could fit all of us they sent me this they maybe they are compensating i
1:19:09 - mean we could have had an suv or something i mean escalate i'm yes sir where are we going
1:19:16 - yes where to go first
1:19:21 - well the closest bridge then overpass do you want
1:19:29 - i understand sir monster hunting yes yeah angela filled me in
1:19:35 - right away thank you so i've got a little tour tonight
1:19:41 - as i mentioned the i-278 bisects the neighborhood cutting it
1:19:48 - almost completely in half and wherever it passes over various
1:19:54 - streets there's a bridge and an overpass and an underpass
1:20:02 - the major deegan expressway circles the neighborhood on the south and the bruckner on the north
1:20:09 - it's almost like the neighborhood is fenced in cut off
1:20:16 - time of night before midnight so not too late there
1:20:22 - are people out there are patrons at dooley's the dive bar that you notice
1:20:29 - there are people in the 24-hour laundromat that you saw
1:20:34 - groups of people out on the street sidewalks going from place to place it isn't busy
1:20:42 - but it isn't deserted either and the little indie coffee shop is
1:20:48 - doing a brisk trade
1:20:53 - i miss coffee that's like the thing yeah right yeah it still smells so good it smells great
1:21:00 - but i can't have it and that bothers me yeah did you ever try to eat food like right
1:21:06 - after you turn absolutely yeah it didn't end well did not
1:21:12 - everywhere just i want to go visit my mom oh and the kitchen smells
1:21:19 - amazing that's bold of you
1:21:24 - yeah there's a bottle of whiskey still sitting in my penthouse
1:21:30 - bet you can't go and i'm never gonna get to drink
1:21:36 - sometimes i stock food trucks i'm i'm sorry stalk yeah okay
1:21:45 - i like watching people eat i mean we
1:21:51 - can eat we just don't taste it it doesn't have the same effect you just have to throw it up
1:21:56 - so you can't eat yeah you could physically eat yes it just doesn't it defeats the purpose yeah it does yeah
1:22:02 - okay well some kindred can eat
1:22:07 - wait hold on you have a penthouse and why are we not hanging out your penthouse look uh
1:22:16 - one day i'll tell you all the story but uh i can't really go back to manhattan
1:22:23 - and uh other than it just being camarilla territory well actually no that's kind of the
1:22:29 - whole story uh sorry i didn't mean to got it and won
1:22:35 - the eyes yeah no no it's an easier story i'm just not used to thinking of it in kindred
1:22:40 - terms now everything's a lot easier to digest than when i first experienced it
1:22:47 - right yeah it was the most life-changing experience
1:22:55 - of my life but the most normal thing of my own life
1:23:02 - you could argue that it is the most life-changing thing that will happen to anybody ever considering you're literally changing life
1:23:11 - sir yes michael slowdown slow down
1:23:18 - that's him that's the reporter as you're passing by the indie coffee shop michael does slow down so that you can look out
1:23:24 - the windows and get a look there's a young man bundled up in a
1:23:29 - heavy-duty parka with a hood he's got a baseball cap
1:23:35 - under the hood and he is uh talking to some of the patrons at the coffee shop
1:23:42 - and he's using his phone clearly to record what they're saying interesting that's that's the guy that's
1:23:49 - the uh that's the journalist looking into the murder right well
1:23:56 - if we see him we'll just you know clock him whenever we see him but we have no reason to get ourselves involved yet
1:24:02 - unless it gets traced to us somehow all right sir does he have a name
1:24:08 - i have not inquired but i can
1:24:13 - uh he's not local
1:24:18 - i don't know okay i doubt it it's
1:24:26 - as terrible as it is these things happen a lot there are plenty of kindred who starting out
1:24:32 - leave evidence it is why it is
1:24:37 - while we from a purely selfish standpoint killing does give the most relief
1:24:44 - it is not the smartest because you leave evidence if you don't kill them they get up and
1:24:51 - walk away and there's no problem it's just
1:24:56 - well one less gentrifier so you know it's a win-win yeah
1:25:01 - i guess not really paying attention to that
1:25:06 - so michael weaves his way up the 278
1:25:12 - south to north going back and forth
1:25:17 - to the underpasses angela is appearing intently out the
1:25:22 - windows her eyes wide clearly searching for something
1:25:28 - concentration on her face is intense i'm going to activate uh eyes of the beast while i'm looking out the window
1:25:35 - looking at any dark spots and seeing if i can see anything hiding
1:25:41 - if i'm on the other side of the car i'll help on the other side with the same
1:25:46 - so anybody who sees the car drive by
1:25:51 - might see what a couple of red laser pointers yeah out each side of the
1:25:57 - uh of the vehicle's rear windows
1:26:04 - it's effective you can certainly see much much easier and see in much more detail
1:26:11 - you get a look at what's under the bridges it's not pretty
1:26:17 - mostly it's trash garbage but sometimes there are people
1:26:23 - occasionally you see groups of people standing around an
1:26:28 - old 55 gallon drum somebody's lit a fire in to keep warm
1:26:35 - i just had an idea michael can we pull over somewhere maybe nearby certainly sir
1:26:41 - he does so who do you think would know the most about this thing other than the people who
1:26:46 - spend most of their time under the bridge are you talking about commiserating with the locals because i think i can help with i love these let's
1:26:52 - commiserate with the locals i like it oh my god i deactivate eyes of the beast
1:27:00 - you cease using the power also all right
1:27:06 - that's information gathered shall we maybe they know something that uh the neighborhood
1:27:11 - watch didn't cut your back sarah do i understand then that you're going
1:27:17 - to approach a group of these people well that's her approach fuego and i will approach the locals
1:27:25 - hmm bless your life yeah rush of life please check for
1:27:30 - hunger it's not extra bad if you get the little skull right it isn't i guess it's just
1:27:35 - weird okay cool so serif you get hungrier yes as well yes yeah
1:27:41 - yes yes it was only a matter of time well i'm not sure that
1:27:48 - this meal would be exactly to your taste but i wouldn't object gross
1:27:57 - and of course in the back of your head you hear his voice
1:28:02 - not really our cup of tea is it not so much
1:28:08 - well i'm not going to wait all night so i expect you to do me proud
1:28:16 - always
1:28:21 - who is approaching fuego and seraph and we'll follow irelies i'll follow behind
1:28:27 - just not directly in front decent distance michael and angela will stay in the car then
1:28:36 - the three men gathered around the drum see you approaching now let's talk about fire
1:28:48 - your beasts don't want to be here they don't want to be near
1:28:54 - that 55 gallon drum and the flames
1:28:59 - inside of it now the fire is controlled and it's small
1:29:06 - and you weren't surprised by it but if you want to approach
1:29:13 - close enough to have a conversation i will have to ask you
1:29:19 - to test for frenzy yeah let's do it
1:29:24 - yes and we will now do that so
1:29:30 - a lot unfortunately fortunately
1:29:36 - the difficulty is only two so take a dice pool
1:29:42 - and that is going to be all black dice no hunger dice in this dice pool because it's all your unspent will power so if
1:29:49 - you've got six blank will power boxes on your sheet you've got six dice in your hand and
1:29:56 - and add dice equal to half your humanity rounded
1:30:02 - down okay all right all you need are two successes
1:30:12 - three three and four i thought you failed [Laughter]
1:30:18 - so perhaps suppressing a shutter you are still able to approach
1:30:24 - looking human and have a conversation ain't you carol walker's kid
1:30:30 - oh [ __ ] yeah she know you're out it's late yeah who's asking she's helping me find
1:30:36 - a place to tag yeah i'm a mert hey mark
1:30:42 - don't tell my mom please what's it worth to you
1:30:48 - that's like the last person in this neighborhood i'm gonna piss off yeah that's fair she'll whoop your ass but i've got 20 bucks if you can help us out
1:30:55 - sold american grab money out of my fart
1:31:08 - you need help here i mean we uh seen exactly you know the hilton
1:31:15 - we're we're uh we're taking a look around we heard there's some somebody picking off some
1:31:20 - of your people some of your people gone missing oh you're talking about the monster yeah yeah well i didn't know if we were calling it that the other men
1:31:27 - nod in agreement yeah any of you seen it i seen it yeah at least i think i did
1:31:34 - okay tell me more um it was under the major deegan
1:31:41 - that was a nice place to hang out until that stupid condo started going up and then
1:31:46 - machinery and construction workers and it's not so nice no
1:31:52 - not anymore anyway uh i think i seen it it was uh it was i guess a person a shape i don't
1:31:59 - know it was dark it's really dark around here you know yeah and uh it was chasing somebody
1:32:06 - it was uh one of those uh it was kids on one of those teeny tiny bicycles yeah you're really too small
1:32:14 - so he was chasing him but honestly i ain't sure what i really saw because
1:32:20 - it didn't look like he was trying too hard to catch him it looked like he was just sort of enjoying it huh the kid was
1:32:26 - freaked out he was just terrified but the kid got away i don't know
1:32:33 - interesting how long ago he didn't stay long enough to look it was smart it was his clothes was torn his you know and he
1:32:40 - had like i don't know he his fingernails have grown long and uh his face was scary um right last week
1:32:48 - last week got like a height like i mean it was running so i don't know okay
1:32:56 - i thought maybe i don't know monster makeup but it ain't halloween
1:33:02 - that's true so i don't know yeah it was scary
1:33:07 - and you don't get scared easy do you mert you can't get scared easy living out here no i would say so
1:33:17 - anybody else seen anything interesting i could ask around yeah is there another 20 bucks in it
1:33:23 - please oh of course thank you i pull out 100. holy [ __ ]
1:33:29 - i need any information you can give me and don't tell my mom and can you guys go get like a meal or
1:33:36 - something like hang out inside for a little bit it's bad out here right now yeah we got a place we could go okay
1:33:44 - how do i reach you i'm um i take out a little black card with a
1:33:51 - phone number on it yeah okay is there anything else written on the
1:33:57 - card it's got a gothic s on the back yes
1:34:02 - serifs ah serif yeah like the font yeah exactly that's valuable to some people
1:34:08 - so you hold on tight to that okay got it he tucks it into his clothing somewhere
1:34:14 - you be careful out there oh we will think's
1:34:25 - you return to the car and keep looking so
1:34:30 - i made you it a week ago for whatever that's worth a week ago it's more than we had before
1:34:35 - long nails but look hunting for fun does that seem like a lupine
1:34:41 - [Music] doesn't fit the story of uh bodies torn in half
1:34:47 - no but lupine are very large
1:34:52 - okay more not easily mistaken for the size of a human being he said his face was real
1:34:58 - scary and looked like halloween makeup so i'm going to lean more towards someone of our size
1:35:05 - okay so michael begins to drive around and under
1:35:12 - the underpasses below the major deegan expressway
1:35:18 - they did mention something about the condominium complex or the building
1:35:23 - going up yeah yeah i wonder if that made something mad other than for
1:35:29 - socioeconomic reasons okay cool the car shutters to a screeching halt if it
1:35:35 - weren't for the seat belts he would pitch forward okay michael [ __ ]
1:35:40 - angela is on her way out of the car there it is what you can see out the windows
1:35:48 - on the right side the sidewalk is
1:35:54 - something monstrous it is perhaps it is or was a vampire at one
1:36:00 - time but now any humanity it might have once had
1:36:07 - has been removed from its features its eyes are wide
1:36:14 - it resembles nothing so much as well ray when he gets very very angry
1:36:19 - do you know him and it is feasting it is
1:36:25 - taking chunks by the clawed handful
1:36:30 - out of someone and devouring it rather messily its eyes register your car
1:36:37 - but it doesn't stop eating we got to do something about this let's
1:36:43 - angela's out and she's already got her gun up and she's firing i get out of the car all right that's dwight same
1:36:50 - okay all right so is there anyone around
1:36:57 - under the expressway here no but you can of course hear the roaring sound of the highway okay above you making sure
1:37:05 - failure anyway she gets off a couple of rounds her aim is uh specific
1:37:13 - the thing doesn't even register that it's been hit although it does look up and it's bloody fangs
1:37:22 - when it looks like can i see its eyes you can see its eyes
1:37:27 - stop what you're doing you want to try to mesmer or actually i do compel
1:37:32 - because it doesn't require our router what will serif be doing while that is happening uh i'd like to do
1:37:38 - symmetry and i would like to try and create a a small fire on its shoulder
1:37:46 - compel is charisma and dominate thank you
1:38:02 - need to beat two three three and you are creating an illusion of a
1:38:08 - small fire a flame something burning and terrifying
1:38:14 - yeah i see wow your role
1:38:20 - is manipulation and obfuscate
1:38:28 - two successes fuego uh fuego's has no she's stunned
1:38:35 - i think she's just watching she doesn't know what to do right rey is going to
1:38:41 - activate toughness and run because we're all coming from the same
1:38:47 - direction so that's correct if it looks like there's a
1:38:52 - direction that it might flee ray's gonna try and head it off that way get in kind of a flanking position so
1:38:59 - you want to try to cut off its most obvious escape yeah get ready to uh is that fair to say yeah get ready to grab
1:39:06 - it if it wants to run towards me toughness requires a rouse check yeah go ahead and
1:39:11 - do that then you get hungrier yeah
1:39:24 - it's just animal noises in your hands that's stereo tonight so
1:39:31 - it stops what it's doing and it stands up and you can see that yes it is wearing
1:39:38 - tattered disgusting grimy clothing it was is maybe
1:39:43 - a vampire it stops eating and then
1:39:49 - it looks over at its shoulder and it howls in fear
1:39:55 - because there's fire and the beast in it loses itself it totally loses its [ __ ]
1:40:04 - oh no it goes absolutely berserk
1:40:11 - damn well perhaps or perhaps not fortunately
1:40:16 - uh you have guessed correctly ray and you are in the way of its escape route
1:40:23 - and you might as well not even be there it roars into you with what feels like the
1:40:30 - power of a subway train do you want to take it do you want to dodge do you want to fight back i'm
1:40:36 - going to try and grab it and hold on for dear life and i'm going to go ahead and give it a blood surge to make sure
1:40:42 - that that happens make the rouse check first please
1:40:49 - success no fire success okay and isaac so
1:40:56 - wait strength and brawl for you is your conflict pool and then i'll roll for this
1:41:01 - whatever it is strengthen brawl plus two for the uh
1:41:08 - blood surge correct plus two for the blood surge one of those should be your hunger dye okay
1:41:18 - three successes hmm three successes also it's the active uh kindred so it
1:41:24 - prevails but neither of you take any damage slams together your toughened undead
1:41:31 - flesh takes the blow the claws scrabble to find a purchase somewhere through your suit when you can feel the fabric
1:41:39 - ripping apart another one gone oh his jaws are snapping at your face and
1:41:45 - you're pretty sure that if it could reach you it would eat your face off right now but it wants to get away it's
1:41:51 - not here to kill you you're simply blocking it it just wants to flee
1:41:58 - but you wanted to initiate a grapple i think yeah and hold it is that right good old bear hug okay it's the active
1:42:05 - kindred but it's not trying to hurt you and you each got three so
1:42:11 - it's grappled it's trying to push past you but it's being held by you
1:42:18 - isaac isaac seeing it run um okay i can't get a shot raising the way
1:42:25 - different times just shoot it anyway and isaac okay extends
1:42:30 - activating feral weapons extends his claws and fangs that his teeth grow his uh nails grown to talons and he charges
1:42:37 - off after ray charges into the fight mm-hmm
1:42:44 - feral weapons requires a rouse check let's go
1:42:49 - that's what i wanted i get
1:42:54 - hungrier yes at last we come to grips with the fall
1:43:00 - it has been a while no stoppings this time no dainty little sips from the teacup
1:43:06 - train him dry we'll see make me warm
1:43:14 - serif i would like to activate the soaring leap and i also go and i'm gonna try and
1:43:19 - grab it by the way gonna jump on its back yep while you're waiting in fuego uh yeah uh
1:43:27 - she's gonna get in there and try to make eye contact and dominate this with the transmirage maneuver around catch its
1:43:33 - eyes see if she can make eye contact what would be the command
1:43:38 - sit sit and ray you're just trying to make sure it doesn't get away yeah if that right
1:43:45 - serif is on it now then i think we're gonna work together to try and pin it down this is gonna get
1:43:50 - complicated because there are several people involved right so
1:43:56 - make a strength and brawl check isaac the same for sarah
1:44:03 - and i don't recall the top of my head did we check yours for
1:44:08 - hunger soaring leap is free so no worries there
1:44:15 - one success one success four successes but i did have to burn a willpower
1:44:20 - he took superficial power damage to re-roll yes okay one success
1:44:28 - and the mesmerism set
1:44:33 - are you using compel or mesmerize mesmerize please roll your manipulation and
1:44:39 - dominate
1:44:46 - uh can i burn a willpower to bloodsurface you absolutely can take superficial willpower damage
1:44:58 - successes how many successes for isaac four one three and three and you're grappling
1:45:04 - okay so here's what happens
1:45:14 - fuego commands it to sit you can see that it almost works
1:45:22 - its knees begin to bend it begins to sink toward the ground and you think for a moment that your will
1:45:28 - has prevailed then it stands up straight it throws serif over its head
1:45:35 - you slam into the side of the underpass bridge with tremendous
1:45:41 - force and you take after having three superficial points of damage
1:45:47 - you hear something give around the rib cage region isaac you plunge your supernatural claws into
1:45:55 - it it howls with rage and pain
1:46:01 - and that's when there's the sound of a car and screeching tires and a vehicle plows into it
1:46:09 - and into ray good great great just how screech honk smash
1:46:18 - ray uh let's see that'll be my car it isn't your car
1:46:26 - isn't michael after having ray
1:46:31 - take four points of superficial damage as you are separated from your foe and flung
1:46:38 - a good dozen feet with two less because it's toughness
1:46:44 - toughness takes it down so not too bad for you but the creature also takes the damage
1:46:50 - it staggers to one side but amazingly does not drop instead
1:46:57 - it does something very similar to what serif did it makes a huge leap and suddenly it's
1:47:03 - clambering up over the bridge onto the traffic
1:47:09 - side of the highway you hear horns screeching tires smashing metal there's a terrible
1:47:15 - accident happening right above you the vehicle that struck the creature is
1:47:22 - improbably a hearse a vintage hearse maybe 50s maybe 60s
1:47:29 - you're not sure it's big and it's heavy and a good thing too because hitting the two of you did a job on the
1:47:36 - grill motioning to you from the driver's side as a face you know
1:47:42 - cat costello the kindred you met at the elevator
1:47:48 - the night you paid rent to richter hmm i need all of you to get in the car now
1:47:54 - what the hell was that my thoughts exactly get in okay get in
1:48:00 - shock all right fine get in the car i'll take the middle
1:48:06 - michael pulls the car your car your minivan
1:48:11 - up behind to follow thank you it's comfortable in here you know you
1:48:16 - weren't sure that a hearse would be something you'd be riding in like this
1:48:22 - something weird about it vampires riding in a car
1:48:27 - meant to carry people to their last rest what the hell was that i don't um well
1:48:34 - look i appreciate you assisting but it did get away because you hit it
1:48:39 - and i think i saved all of you from your final death because i hit it too you didn't know what you were doing obviously
1:48:44 - okay what are you doing out here oh she also has a skull in the car with her

1:51:25 - wants to do something nice is somebody holding me back from this well she is driving so i'd appreciate
1:51:31 - not killing her at this moment yeah yeah that would take some restraint and that would take some
1:51:36 - forethought to not mess up what someone's doing when they're concentrating
1:51:42 - yeah cat in the rear view mirror as you speed north on the 278
1:51:47 - you can see the lights of emergency vehicles back on the major deegan there's been

1:51:58 - yes unfortunately aren't aren't you guys
1:52:04 - like babies well i prefer the term freshman but yeah i guess grown-ass woman but thanks okay
1:52:10 - if when there's something you don't understand just for the future if there's something you don't understand maybe find someone like me to help you
1:52:17 - out before you just whatever that was just throw it to the uh
1:52:22 - cause a scene like that we weren't causing a scene until you showed up no one was there
1:52:28 - sure i mean it did get away and go onto the bridge because you removed it from our grasp i'm not
1:52:34 - i'm not being antagonistic i'm just saying but do you know what that thing was i assume
1:52:39 - sorry i'll ask the question what the [ __ ] was that i don't know i'm asking you well what you said
1:52:45 - i have a suspicion but i don't know if i'm correct okay it was my fault
1:52:51 - i was the one that no it wasn't children what just no it's okay sweetie it wasn't your fault it was
1:52:58 - your fault that it ran but it was not your fault um
1:53:04 - i think it's one of us that's lost all ability to think
1:53:10 - ugh is that a thing that happens i don't know i just love normally what i'm
1:53:16 - gathering from what it looked like frankie do you know what that thing was
1:53:22 - no well i they don't know either is she talking to the skull right yeah yes because if i
1:53:28 - look up and she's talking to the skull
1:53:34 - ray you feel a distinct
1:53:40 - drop in the temperature in the car
1:53:46 - around you it's like you stepped out
1:53:51 - side in the middle of a cold winter night without a coat
1:53:58 - you notice that the window
1:54:03 - next to you has developed little ice crystals
1:54:09 - in a pattern the pattern says
1:54:24 - i will make no mention of this to anyone no one else sees it but you and no one
1:54:29 - else feels the sudden not something i am equipped to process right now all
1:54:36 - right i'm going to go ahead and just breeze by all that because it's something we'll have to clean up later
1:54:41 - obviously why were you looking for us i have a bone to pick with all of you
1:54:46 - you are approaching these besides that one
1:54:53 - you're approaching the woodlawn exit are you taking them home yes we're going back to my house can you
1:54:59 - describe the neighborhood that you end up in as you come off the ramp well it's a neighborhood i know very well because my
1:55:06 - whole family we own every single business around woodlawn cemetery this is this is our piece
1:55:13 - as we're driving down the street i see people i know i see my cousins i see my friends my
1:55:18 - my brothers my second cousin removed from my mother's side tommy he's over there hanging out on the street corner
1:55:24 - probably collecting or is this a residential neighborhood are there businesses
1:55:30 - businesses several businesses along the street and then to the right coming up you can see woodlawn cemetery
1:55:37 - and that's where you go woodlawn cemetery is
1:55:43 - one of the largest burial grounds in new york city
1:55:48 - it's practically a small city by itself but inside the gate
1:55:53 - which opens for you even though there's no one here there is a mortuary a place where of
1:56:01 - course people take their loved ones after they die and this is where you're going
1:56:08 - yeah pulling into the mortuary it's a business of course it's part funeral
1:56:13 - home it's part place of care and a place of rest
1:56:19 - and place of preparation well it's kind of on the nose don't you
1:56:24 - think hearse cemetery sorry even here in the
1:56:30 - mortuary the car headlights pick out gravestones markers little mausoleums
1:56:38 - white gray reflecting the light
1:56:44 - what happens when you get here i turned to them and i said okay we're here i think we should just go inside
1:56:50 - somewhere private and then we can talk about this does that sound good fine what did you want to talk about
1:56:58 - and go inside and we'll find out i lead them to the front door
1:57:04 - the business side the funeral parlor well this is the most interesting thing
1:57:10 - that's happening right now i mean why wouldn't we do it i don't know because she's working with freddy's spaghetti
1:57:16 - well we don't know that i text angela to come with me michael to stay in the car with all the windows rolled and doors locked until i i tell him we're on our
1:57:23 - way out cat do the gates allow isaac's minivan to enter
1:57:30 - yes they do then the minivan i swear it pulls in
1:57:36 - and parks angela signals through texting you or understanding
1:57:45 - inside the funeral home it's quite mundane it's a place intended
1:57:52 - to be comforting so it looks a lot like the interior of a comfortable home
1:57:58 - there are comfortable chairs and couches bookshelves full of books desks
1:58:04 - it's well lit it's pleasant perhaps even calming
1:58:10 - thank you you're welcome thank you are you okay
1:58:15 - let's just hear her around because that thing is long gone now
1:58:22 - i decorated it myself so um what i wanted to discuss with you
1:58:30 - i got a call the other day uh from marco putnasca do you know him
1:58:35 - we thought you knew him of course i know him i'm not personally i know of him you
1:58:42 - know of him okay well good um so he told me that some men that work
1:58:50 - for him got the [ __ ] kicked out of them the other night yeah that was us
1:58:57 - they're honest frankie we like that i wouldn't sorry
1:59:02 - so he here's the issue with that
1:59:08 - marco putnesca had some nobody uh call him asking him about some some
1:59:16 - computer software shrek neck or something like that i don't know what it is uh drexler
1:59:23 - some some some guy named drexler and a shrek neck whatever calling about some computer software so marco's men stole
1:59:30 - it like they said they would they brought it to him right and then drexler never paid them
1:59:36 - right so they show up to collect
1:59:43 - and they just get the [ __ ] kicked out of them by some codery you guys well wrong place wrong time yes yeah we were there
1:59:51 - to see draxler because he had not paid richter
1:59:56 - i see and we were collecting for richter
2:00:02 - well that all makes sense and look the way i see it everyone has a legitimate claim to
2:00:08 - grievance here for example
2:00:14 - you [ __ ] up someone that i'm associated with so [ __ ] you at the same time
2:00:22 - they were [ __ ] up somebody on your turf so [ __ ] them yeah
2:00:27 - it's kind of like a net zero situation okay what what's your kind of play here because we
2:00:32 - saw you at richter's yeah i don't i don't have a play taking sides
2:00:38 - is not my thing my play is is the work that i that i do here
2:00:43 - with the frankie here here at the the mortuary i know
2:00:50 - you know uh you're not just gonna coast through this
2:00:56 - life eternal death will come for all of us
2:01:01 - hopefully not soon while this conversation is going on i'm just gonna text drexler and say what do you owe
2:01:08 - marco the return text a few moments later is who wants to know
2:01:17 - you know the last aloha the big goodbye learning more about that
2:01:26 - right do you need a moment i'm good ah
2:01:31 - okay would you be you are i am akata
2:01:38 - proudly yes i'm thinking it makes a lot of
2:01:44 - sense but there's still a major issue with this situation okay friends yes okay
2:01:52 - the putin eska quarter of a million are pissed okay and you don't want them crawling up your
2:01:59 - ass like they've been crawling up my ass for decades believe me if if i was if if
2:02:04 - i was alive they'd give me the worst splitting [ __ ] headache i swear okay okay
2:02:10 - okay i can help keep them off your ass if you like in exchange for
2:02:17 - a little a little favor you could do for me uh you see there's this uh
2:02:24 - there's something i want and it's it's on your turf
2:02:31 - what is it well in in the year 1780 there was this
2:02:38 - uh ship the the hms hussar and it
2:02:43 - sunk in the east river and there was a captain on on the ship
2:02:51 - yeah i'm telling them about charlie frank jeez there was a captain on this ship
2:02:56 - and and i would like to speak to him but his remains are rumored to be under
2:03:03 - this uh luxury condominium complex that they're building ah
2:03:08 - where you all uh-huh reside i would love to help you with this yeah i would as
2:03:14 - well i wonder if the monster is connected
2:03:20 - that thing really shook up the whole town well it seems to be hanging out with
2:03:25 - or prowling around with the base of that tower
2:03:30 - and maybe that shook it up maybe they're connected they might not be but they might be connected
2:03:38 - that's very an interesting place oh thank you
2:03:43 - so if you could bring me you know some of his remains preferably his skull um okay
2:03:49 - i would love that no exactly yeah why do we need to do this
2:03:56 - so keep the putin ask off your ass cause they're pissed remember i told you right they know how
2:04:02 - do they know it was us of course they know it was you did you tell them it was us i didn't tell them
2:04:09 - who told them i don't know come on i have no idea who told them
2:04:15 - all i know is that marco who told them and he dominates he's going to attempt to use dominate on
2:04:23 - cat so what are you trying to do mesmerism mesmerizing the appropriate one this
2:04:29 - will be contested first arouse check i'm good
2:04:39 - your role is manipulation and dominating cat
2:04:44 - you need to make a role with a pool of your intelligence plus your
2:04:50 - resolve two attributes
2:04:56 - how many successes six successes two how many
2:05:01 - black failed dice do you have four do you want to spend willpower to re-roll those
2:05:08 - and do you want to call upon the power of your blood to increase the chances of resistance no it's okay
2:05:15 - well the supernatural command lashes out almost like a psychic whip
2:05:24 - okay somebody said that they saw me talking to a coterie that that looked
2:05:29 - like you guys at cage and i said yeah
2:05:36 - and maybe he maybe he doesn't know maybe i could call him back and say hey
2:05:42 - it wasn't them if you get me this skull ah
2:05:48 - great then we're on the same page wonderful then we will
2:05:54 - attempt to get you the skull if you keep our name out of their mouth
2:06:02 - that sounds like a deal to me but you have the number so you have the name
2:06:08 - yes can you ask what the name is ah yes who i mean it was the bookmasks
2:06:15 - right but who of the putin esca specifically what's the name it was marco putin

2:07:27 - it is unnaturally cold it is not room temperature like you would think
2:07:33 - bone should be it's heavier than you thought

2:07:51 - caressing stroking
2:07:59 - i want to whisper to frankie
2:08:06 - what do you tell him can you hear me
2:08:13 - the skull jerks a little and vibrates in your hand
2:08:19 - it's the strangest thing is he getting fresh with you i'm sorry i could take him back no we're having a lovely
2:08:25 - conversation and i want to try to whisper into his
2:08:31 - ear wherever that is he you're the general ear hole
2:08:36 - uh you work for me now and i want to try to dominate
2:08:42 - frankie you're looking into the eyes of the skull
2:08:47 - yeah sure this is a normal thing to do roll manipulation and dominate
2:09:02 - three
2:09:08 - a book from the shelf behind you flies off strikes the back of your chair and then
2:09:14 - another and another and then suddenly a whole barrage of books fly from the shelf striking on your head and your
2:09:20 - shoulders that one hurt what did you do nothing and i toss it
2:09:26 - back i catch him
2:09:31 - he's really quite pleasant the books cease their missile barrage at you
2:09:38 - okay we'll find charlie for you and i promised your friend here a suit
2:09:44 - um hey free suit free suit yeah
2:09:50 - just not one off the recently deceased how about that oh
2:09:57 - um i i guess i can i can see what i i i
2:10:03 - think most of ours have been never mind
2:10:08 - you seem very pleasant um
2:10:16 - do you have anyone who might know or be able to confirm what that thing we were dealing with was
2:10:22 - considering as you said if we don't know something to ask someone like you
2:10:27 - who doesn't have the information can i ask my friends
2:10:42 - it's franklin who replies
2:10:50 - it's a white
2:10:55 - it was one of them that ain't one of them it's a white
2:11:03 - bad news are they back
2:11:11 - we feel things that belong to them
2:11:18 - on the big island
2:11:26 - oh jesus what that's not a good reaction
2:11:32 - no you bet your ass is not a good reaction
2:11:38 - okay your babies how can i put this um
2:11:46 - a long time ago there were some of us that
2:11:52 - were pretty bad um
2:11:59 - and they used to
2:12:05 - hit people with shovels and and it was uh
2:12:10 - they're they're called the sabbat and i can't i can't you okay
2:12:17 - they are bad you are correct yeah and your clan used to be associated
2:12:28 - look not me no association through no no no no i mean no look i'm in the same boat
2:12:34 - my clan was associated
2:12:40 - what are you it's amazing you said not to tell people
2:12:46 - what oh lovely uh so y'all can at some point down the line
2:12:53 - was associated yeah but that's not that's not something we want
2:13:00 - me neither good
2:13:11 - oh they so apparently my friends
2:13:17 - told me that they they've been sensing some activity on the main island
2:13:24 - uh with those types interesting so lucky for you it seems to be more of
2:13:31 - a camarilla problem all right but honestly
2:13:38 - that's just gonna be all our problems real soon yeah they don't not known for being quiet
2:13:45 - no any clue on what to do to stop them
2:13:52 - i can probably try and figure something out i mean i suggest that you talk to
2:13:59 - maybe older vamp kindred kindred that have more experience
2:14:05 - how'd they get stopped last time
2:14:12 - it's a long story yeah a big a big event
2:14:19 - i don't really know what happened i just heard rumors
2:14:24 - angela text you isaac sir it's getting late
2:14:30 - yes i appreciate the information we should
2:14:36 - be going though sun will be coming one more thing before you go if it's
2:14:42 - okay i was wondering um
2:14:48 - if if one of you can tell me about your last breath
2:14:55 - mine's not particularly exciting someone else i'll go but why
2:15:02 - you know it's it's research for me because i i study um
2:15:07 - on life and and i like i just like to know okay
2:15:13 - valentine's day my
2:15:19 - messiah said he wanted to talk to me about
2:15:25 - an opportunity to expand my study under him
2:15:32 - there were candles poured me some champagne he congratulated me saying it was
2:15:40 - the opportunity of a lifetime
2:15:45 - then i woke up i ran
2:15:53 - do you remember what it felt like when when the life was leaving your body
2:16:01 - it felt really good
2:16:07 - i bet it did
2:16:12 - sorry okay look if you ever need anything
2:16:19 - i would like to give you my card she takes her card out thank you cat
2:16:26 - it's the name of the mortuary and the funeral home on it yes costello
2:16:32 - funeral services thank you you're welcome
2:16:42 - hopefully the next time we meet not as dramatic and
2:16:48 - did you get an answer on what that thing was you reacted
2:16:54 - quite painfully it looks like a sabbat project gone wrong
2:17:01 - um unfortunate well
2:17:07 - good evening then good night good night i text michael on
2:17:12 - our way back to the car so
2:17:19 - back to your domain once we get in the car i have something i need to say to them
2:17:26 - michael drives so unfortunate turn of events for the
2:17:32 - evening not necessarily how we wanted to end it are you all right right
2:17:37 - i'm fine i'm just uh you know start from square one and then also
2:17:43 - chase a ghost right so i think i was half right maybe i don't
2:17:48 - know any more information but i do have someone we can talk to it will
2:17:56 - require a trip longer than a car ride
2:18:03 - i'll have to make arrangements i don't know when we can go see them
2:18:08 - but my sire would know about these kind of things well
2:18:14 - so i'll see if i can arrange that at some point but until then let's find
2:18:21 - this skull shall we there's something else that you should know
2:18:26 - yes costello was talking about drexler
2:18:32 - owing the putin eska's uh a lot of money right a lot of money
2:18:38 - about a quarter million that's a lot what the f and based on what we've gleaned
2:18:46 - of her i don't think her protecting us from the putinis because it's worth a quarter
2:18:52 - million i think they're gonna be a little more invested
2:18:58 - in getting that back so we should probably look into extra ability
2:19:04 - to cover our asses yes that would be a good plan now i'm unclear on whether or not they were purchasing the items that
2:19:11 - drexler had or he was getting them for like my understanding is that he
2:19:16 - requested them and then paid promised to pay a fee
2:19:23 - right so to receive them that makes sense so we can't just and then was probably gonna sell it on for i
2:19:29 - assume if he's a smart businessman which i'm starting to doubt
2:19:34 - i'm assuming he was going to get paid more than that right so
2:19:40 - different plan find out who he was going to sell them to considering i have all of them
2:19:48 - hmm yeah all right
2:19:53 - i thought the hakata was supposed to be like cool and scary was she not cool and scary no just weird
2:20:01 - and sad not all kindred are the same
2:20:06 - just because you're a member of a clan doesn't mean you follow stereotypes
2:20:12 - look at you you care about a community how many ventures do that
2:20:22 - okay
2:20:27 - with that to think about as you drive through the night
2:20:33 - back to your home turf that seems like the perfect place to
2:20:39 - end our vampire story for now
2:20:50 - you
