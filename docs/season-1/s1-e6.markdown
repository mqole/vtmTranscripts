# Season 1 Episode 6 - When I Am Hungry

### WIP- current captions directly ripped from youtube.

0:00 - hello good evening and welcome to our vampire the masquerade chronicle new york by night
0:10 - we continue our story following the experiences of a coterie of
0:16 - fledgling anarch vampires in the bronx with season one
0:22 - episode six when i am hungry let's meet our hungry vampires
0:30 - hi i'm alex ford and i play isaac a pristine zamitsy
0:37 - hi i'm mayana baron i play sarah the less than pristine ravnos
0:43 - hi i'm abria iron guy playing fuego a incensed ventrue
0:50 - and i'm joey rasul i play ray the conflicted gang girl
0:58 - one of the things that isn't conflicted is the thanks we owe to our special friends and sponsors
1:04 - thank you black magic design for the beautiful cameras that allow us to come to you the family in unliving color
1:11 - thank you to renegade game studios for making sure we have hunger dice when we
1:16 - need to roll them and thank you to dogmite games for this beautiful storyteller screen
1:23 - and player dice boxes thank you
1:30 - as a prologue let's think about how some kindred often
1:36 - describe their own lives as a strange kind of dance they sway and step and turn
1:44 - this way in that way moving to a music that some of them want to remember forever
1:52 - and that some of them would gladly forget the younger the kindred
1:58 - the harder it is to dance this dance because their connection to their humanity is
2:05 - still fresh still strong in the human voice that they hear mitigates
2:11 - the more bestial lyrics of the vampire dance
2:17 - but as they age and as they climb out of the
2:23 - bottom layer of that blood rich cake we've been talking about climb up under the smaller middle level
2:30 - the dance becomes easier the mitigating human voice grows fainter
2:38 - and that creates new problems dangerous problems so they pretend
2:45 - and they pretend so well in fact that they sometimes convince themselves of their humanity
2:52 - but that is really like you or i putting on a halloween mask looking in the mirror and
2:57 - pretending that it's our real face isn't it some kindred can go quite a long time
3:03 - playing at this illusion months decades but eventually the echo does grow faint
3:11 - and the kindred begins to slide toward that hungry shadow
3:17 - where the bestial music plays maybe they try to clamber back to a more
3:23 - comfortable illusion maybe they try to climb up to the very
3:28 - top of that layer kick or maybe they just allowed the controlled fall downward
3:36 - with this firmly in mind let's tell a vampire story
3:50 - [Music]
4:30 - [Music]
4:42 - [Music]
4:55 - [Music]
5:07 - our codery has experienced another intense evening of discovery most of it very personal
5:14 - while they were searching a construction site for a missing skull
5:20 - they met bree a gangrel who had rather specific opinions about
5:27 - freedom and autonomy they had a violent encounter with mortal
5:34 - security guards that resulted in a mortal death
5:39 - and an impromptu ghouling and they learned things about one another that maybe they wish they hadn't
5:47 - but it's the same night so where are we now
5:55 - we're someplace that is by now familiar to the coterie more or less the cage
6:02 - richter's nightclub where the self-styled vampire crime boss
6:07 - of the bronx makes his headquarters on the shore of the east river
6:15 - now the river is the perfect metaphor for unlife isn't it
6:20 - surface smooth and at night it reflects pale moonlight and the
6:26 - sodium orange street lights perfectly even when it's tossed by wind and storms
6:33 - the surface of the river can be beautiful but
6:38 - just under the surface where the currents become swift and unpredictable
6:43 - the waters hide all manner of obstacles both natural and unnatural
6:50 - once this part of the river right outside the cage
6:57 - was called the hell gate due to its severe turbulence
7:02 - and hidden rocks and only very skilled pilots and ship captains could hope to navigate it
7:08 - safely eventually the worst of the rocks were removed to make it safer
7:16 - but for kindred the only thing that can make their own lives any safer
7:21 - is themselves so outside the cage
7:29 - perhaps you thought your night was over when you parted ways
7:34 - perhaps an hour ago but now you all find yourselves
7:40 - arriving outside the club as much as you left it
7:46 - the last time you were here three stories of brick concrete steel
7:52 - and attitude the outside a lattice work of
7:59 - metal fire escapes catwalks rusting machinery that belong to the
8:04 - decommissioned shell of the cement plant that the club is built inside
8:10 - there's music coming from the interior not a band you would think
8:16 - a dj the music is energetic
8:24 - lively and here you are
8:31 - the last time we met here was
8:36 - i don't know better
8:42 - i don't know we seem to be in a better position than we were then we're not in trouble this time as far as we know
8:49 - i didn't like the tone of that text yeah i mean is richter ever not angry
8:56 - there was one time he wasn't true that pleasantness doesn't extend to all
9:03 - the rest of us i believe though i could i'm a good sharer
9:13 - well is he going to keep us waiting around like normal or are we going to get to
9:18 - actually go in and talk to him i think we should just go inside honestly i'm sure consuela will
9:24 - make herself known yes you are entirely correct
9:30 - no sooner have you reached the front entrance to the club moving past around and
9:37 - through groups of mortals here to dance here to party here to have a good time
9:45 - when consuela does in fact make an appearance hello
9:51 - on time again we try our best we aim to please
9:57 - that's what we all like to hear consuela is tired similarly to the last
10:04 - time you saw her but not identically the little black dress that was more
10:09 - appropriate to a cocktail hour than to a nightclub has been replaced by a kind of
10:15 - tight-fitting pantsuit still with the thigh-high soft low-heeled boots those
10:21 - seems to uh seems to enjoy those as she does enjoy the opera gloves
10:26 - that she likes to wear the curly red hair has been replaced by
10:32 - darker wavier dresses not sure which one was the wig
10:40 - she isn't wearing the eyeglasses that she had on last time either maybe they weren't real either
10:48 - so good to see you again margo you're looking great as ever
10:54 - i try you look absolutely fantastic thank you
11:03 - hey killer excited to be here i can tell
11:09 - we're excited to have you okay gonna give us any kind of hint
11:16 - about what's going on rent so soon i actually don't know
11:21 - so why don't we take you on up
11:26 - no band tonight just a dj i don't know who they are exactly and
11:32 - i probably won't book them back but you know hey a friend of yours is here tonight
11:39 - do you remember the pretty lady who let you uh play with her toys the last time you were here come on simone yeah
11:47 - she's around we're opening the pit tonight oh interesting you should drop by yes
11:54 - maybe you'd like to take a turn
11:59 - airbox feel like uh going around or two
12:04 - the wager on that particular grudge match might make even richter rich
12:11 - only if he bets on me i'll let him know i'd love to see it
12:19 - so ready yes here she leads you to
12:25 - the service elevator the same one you took last time apparently that's the way
12:33 - upward you go three stories to the top the elevator door
12:39 - opens and you are in richter's meeting room once again with its very long table with its many chairs
12:47 - the window has been repaired and the view out into the parking lot
12:54 - across the old cement works down onto the east river and the lights of rikers island and the brew of queens
13:01 - beyond is unblemished once again richter
13:06 - is here airbox isn't
13:12 - lizzy is there's a kindred here you don't recognize
13:18 - short long beautiful black hair tied up in a queue
13:24 - beard square solid he's wearing one of those letterman
13:31 - style jackets leather and cloth
13:39 - as soon as you enter he walks over towards you
13:45 - sticks out a hand to you ray mario
13:51 - take his hand give a bit of a squeeze he does too it's firm dry

14:50 - evening nice to see you all in
14:57 - the hell is this monster thing uh oh that's what it's about
15:03 - i told you not to make [ __ ] my problem unfortunately we had some interference
15:08 - from an outside source yeah do tell
15:13 - well when we were taking care of the problem a1 uh miss costello you gonna blame this
15:20 - on cat costello i'm not blaming anything i'm just saying what happened i thought it'd be good
15:25 - hit both ray and the creature with their car hurst to be precise
15:31 - and the monster escaped you look old so if you like we can blame it on our car not her
15:37 - you look all right oh we're all fine yeah i have a habit of doing that well
15:42 - unfortunately i got taller windows unfortunately the monster escaped and caused a little bit of an accident on
15:48 - the bridge so that's what that was yes yeah that got on the news
15:54 - eyewitness reports some you know dangerous person
16:00 - or thing or creature running across the i-278 and major deegan yeah yeah
16:08 - what is it it appears to be one of us that has lost its ability to
16:14 - reason you mean it's a white a white if that's what it's called
16:20 - i think he was white what i'm sorry what lizzie
16:26 - seated at the table next to richter stops contemplating her very long sharp
16:32 - talon-like fingernails she's dressed tonight in prada
16:38 - tattered torn destroyed
16:43 - she leans forward really attentively to listen to what you have to say going
16:49 - so far as to move her long shaggy hair away from one eye so that she can
16:55 - pay attention really carefully it looked like one of us that was um
17:04 - very thin sunken very hungry was eating someone when we found it like eating eating like chunks of flesh
17:12 - and the like yeah all right so who was it
17:18 - don't know whites don't start out as whites they start out as us he didn't give us a name it's what the
17:25 - they say it's what happens when you lose it all
17:31 - when the beast gets what it wants when we don't say no often enough
17:37 - i mean i wouldn't know myself but well some of you might have a better idea
17:44 - than others what that could be like
17:49 - that's why i try hard to hold back good idea try harder
17:55 - so it's running around your territory yes
18:01 - it's killing mortals i mean i don't really care about that i do care
18:07 - that it's getting attention yes yeah it will be dealt with unfortunately the interruption causes to lose track of it
18:13 - we'll find it again and take care of it how are you gonna do that same way we found it in the first place
18:19 - go to where we hear it feeds you're gonna drive around until you find it
18:24 - or some similar application of knowledge huh
18:31 - are you offering a suggestion on how we should go about this if you make it my problem i'll solve it but it'll uh
18:39 - be unpleasant for you we're perfectly capable of solving it we were doing all right i got total
18:45 - confidence in you margo
18:50 - well consuela's shoulders are vibrating as he says this
18:56 - but she keeps a straight face you gonna save me a dance later always
19:04 - she bites the inside of her lip was that what you needed from us
19:10 - pretty much how's it going before we get off that topic richter do
19:18 - you want us to deal with it no questions asked or do you want this thing brought back here
19:24 - you seem kind of interested as far as i know they didn't have much to say
19:30 - you were asking who it was yeah sometimes you can tell i guess right maybe it's still got a driver's
19:35 - license who knows i didn't mean it was one of us once
19:40 - who knows how it got that way doesn't that mean as a kindred in your territory
19:46 - i do believe that's your territory now like i said if i have to solve it i will but you won't like it
19:53 - fair enough well if it turns out that we can't handle it i'm sure we will bring it to your attention
19:59 - oh i imagine it'll get to my attention and if it gets that far
20:04 - so if it is white if it was one of us i mean
20:11 - there's one thing that always does the trick fire
20:19 - precisely applied yes oh yeah you got to be careful about that sort of thing
20:24 - wouldn't do to slip i do have a certain thing that i acquired recently that
20:30 - could help us in this you always do
20:35 - so yeah that's pretty much what i wanted except how is it going
20:43 - a few growing pains but we're doing rather well if i do say so myself you like being landlords
20:49 - i don't like that word but nothing new yeah i don't think it's too fashionable anymore right
20:55 - but the neighborhood is nice and the people are agreeable i think i've ever heard that okay
21:04 - whatever you seem tense shouldn't you be celebrating this
21:09 - callahan business is gonna get out of control
21:16 - remember what we talked about boss callahan feared anarch leader
21:22 - yes like i said nobody liked him but
21:29 - has sent kindred to poke around in that business and poking around
21:34 - in the bronx torx making kissy face with the camarilla
21:40 - the self-proclaimed new baron seems a lot more interested in feathering his own nest than he does
21:48 - leading the uh anarchs if you meet him and talk to him i'll be curious to know what you think i don't
21:54 - like the guy personally i haven't heard anything good about him yeah me either
21:59 - he's got a big coterie and a lot of people pay attention to what he says a lot of kindred too
22:05 - what's his clan sam's mine it's bruja
22:10 - oh we just do things differently i do what i want
22:22 - i'll give you one for free got questions you know i do but someone else can go
22:31 - i have none by all means
22:38 - it's on your mind ray no i think i think the ladies first yeah sounds like you guys got it all
22:45 - figured out and you don't need my help like you said you don't want us to make things your problem nope
22:52 - don't say and didn't offer no the offer is appreciated
22:58 - well ain't got much of the night left you're welcome to enjoy the club for what's left of it
23:06 - bronx cheers still around uh they're not on tonight but they're here someplace
23:12 - actually i do have a question have you heard about any
23:18 - anarchs coming from the west coast
23:24 - now what makes you ask that i heard some things yeah and i just wondered if it was a
23:32 - problem we should be worried about if something major happened out there that i don't know much about what goes on in
23:38 - la i hear the free states are back whatever that means didn't know they ever left really
23:44 - i heard about baron victor temple declaring the whole of california an
23:52 - anarch free-for-all let me know how that works out for him
23:57 - it's a big place yeah and i might have heard
24:02 - that one or two free radicals left the free states made their way here
24:08 - recently here they've been talking a torque interesting i thought so
24:15 - why is everyone talking to torque because torque is the baron claims he is anyone can claim anything
24:23 - that's right you want to be barren sarah if you want to be barren that's nice no i definitely don't want to be
24:30 - barren an unfortunate road for ones as young as we are too much work
24:35 - i got [ __ ] to do so uh yeah enjoy yourself
24:41 - pits open ah interesting cage is open
24:49 - usual rules apply this ain't no elysium so watch your step
24:55 - you know what i mean by elysium yes all right that's what i thought
25:03 - old custom really old as old as us sacred ground
25:09 - neutral ground any place that's elysium any kindred theoretically can go
25:15 - and expect to be safe different cities run it differently
25:23 - it's more popular with the camarilla is there one for the anarchs not that i know of
25:29 - camarillo's got several in theory even an anarch could walk in
25:34 - there and they have no choice but to allow it
25:40 - it's just the walking out part that's hard that's usually where the complication comes
25:46 - so uh yeah enjoy yourselves drinks on the house of course
25:53 - and like i said when i'm done i hope uh still time for a dance for you always
25:59 - i think you'll find uh simone at the pit unless i miss my guess
26:05 - thank you
26:13 - isaac yes lizzy parts the other half of her hair
26:19 - so that she can look at you with both eyes this time
26:26 - when you fought the monster did it say anything
26:34 - not to my memory
26:39 - but i will be sure to tell you when i see it again thank you
26:47 - i can't wait to hear let's see i've got a dolce gabbana suit
26:54 - that would match that outfit perfectly and i think we would make a great couple together she
27:00 - clacks her long lacquered nails together excitedly maybe next time
27:11 - i'm just having a stare off with consuela social warfare you say
27:17 - um what impression do you want to make do
27:23 - you want to make her look away do you want to convey a message i think i'm just staring her down and
27:30 - daring her to look away first all right
27:37 - three rounds and out okay would you say that you're being
27:42 - more charming or more manipulative as you do this
27:48 - i want to say it's charming just rubbing it in aren't you just twisting that knife having a great time
27:55 - consuela's gut okay so make a pool of charisma and intimidation
28:02 - that's for you that six dice should include your hunger dice and i will roll for uh consuela
28:09 - can i search make a rouse check check your hunger
28:16 - i'm fine you don't hear that voice in your head and you don't get hungrier
28:23 - so now add two dice to your pool ready
28:30 - two successes four two more times
28:36 - keep the same pool for the seat okay [Music] two successes
28:42 - plan one two three seven success
28:48 - third round so we had the opening look the locking of
28:53 - eyes the intense staring three successes three successes but your total
29:00 - far outweighs consuela's total
29:06 - and she drops her gaze in defeat
29:17 - when she looks back up she says let's go i'll take you down
29:23 - thank you dance floor or pit level
29:30 - pit level just pushes the button hey consuela
29:36 - there was somebody in the tannin booth a couple nights ago yeah what was their name
29:42 - why do you want to know i just can't i i'm curious
29:48 - you think it was somebody you knew i don't think so i just
29:54 - want to know called himself jerry what'd he do
30:02 - he stole good to know
30:10 - and he led a hunter
30:16 - to another kindred what does that mean
30:23 - they're immortals who hunt us didn't you ever watch the x-files
30:29 - no wow i love that show yeah there's there's monster hunters out

30:42 - what thing what'd you get did you get a toy i did what was it
30:48 - a steak gross yeah but
30:53 - one of the things they use generally speaking okay
31:00 - noted you were right right elevator comes to a halt
31:06 - the bottom floor of the cage door is open and you can hear the excited sounds
31:12 - of voices and fighting coming from the direction of the pit
31:20 - last stop everybody out and get out thank you consuela
31:25 - later enjoy your steak
31:32 - so where do we want to go i want to see what the [ __ ] this pit is
31:38 - yeah yeah why not did uh mario come down with us you don't see him
31:45 - might have come ahead of you he was still up there though when you left
31:52 - i'll walk around with these guys for a bit and then maybe circle around and find him again okay the pit is a lot like
31:59 - what you left last time you saw it big sunken concrete square hole in the center of a room
32:06 - with aluminum bleachers rising several levels above it and a very very sturdy iron rail going
32:13 - all the way around except this time the bleachers have a dozen or so
32:20 - creatures kindred you assume in them a lot of faces you've never seen
32:28 - two you have simone who is sitting in what must be the vip
32:34 - box at the very very top she's accompanied by
32:40 - mortals who are attending her every whim the other is
32:46 - francis the guitarist from the band bronx chair
32:51 - he's sitting on the opposite side he's alternately
32:57 - watching the fight and watching simone across
33:06 - he's wearing a tank top with the graphic print design
33:12 - of a smiling face surrounded by the sun i would like to cast shimistry
33:19 - to francis and i would like to do a little floating graffiti that just says hi
33:27 - so make it manipulation and obfuscate and
33:34 - it requires a rouse check too okay
33:42 - i don't get hungrier there must be some mistake
33:52 - uh two normal success one critical one fail three so three yeah three successes
33:59 - total his head
34:04 - snaps around as the illusion manifests itself is it colorful
34:09 - uh yeah it's it's kind of like a dancing you know like one of those 3d paint simulator type things
34:16 - and it's got some purple and some gold high like watching spray paint appear
34:21 - out of thin air on thin air startled he turns around and looks for the source and
34:32 - i'm going there so all right ray margot
34:39 - i'm going to activate awe and then go slide in to say hi to simone
34:46 - ray's just sitting watching the fights in the pit for now seeing uh
34:52 - who steps up who's uh who's making bets who's watching who's
34:57 - interested in which fights that kind of thing just kind of clock in the room hold that thought
35:04 - isaac i'm gonna follow fuego
35:10 - fuego and isaac slide into the vip booth are they
35:16 - allowed to slide into the vip booth absolutely
35:23 - the mortals disentangle themselves a little to make room for you
35:28 - they're langurous happy a little drunk
35:33 - they've got champagne and a bucket on the floor
35:40 - come for a visit oh i've missed you and everything you're about
35:47 - how are you wonderful you know violence can be a
35:52 - very entertaining thing on its own but it's truly the interpersonal
35:58 - that intrigues me all around the room
36:03 - can i freshen your drink and i want to like grab for the bottle and refill her glass
36:09 - are you choosing to drink champagne
36:15 - absolutely not just for show then
36:20 - no i do like my meals a little bubbly on the inside
36:26 - then i'll push past you with the glass and hand it off too uh whoever i think is a hand reaches out of the tangle of
36:32 - limbs grabs for the champagne incredible don't feel like you need to serve them
36:39 - they're more than capable of handling your themselves have a seat
36:45 - don't mind if i do thank you um second guest
36:51 - it's looking to be an entertaining evening how are you i'm well how are you
36:57 - splendid good so what brings you both to the pit
37:06 - i heard it's opening night i wanted to check it out it looks as brutally violent as promised that's
37:14 - exactly what it is and of course rey sees this too because he's observing the fight the first fight matches seem to be
37:21 - ghouls and they are unarmed
37:27 - and they are exhibiting rather good mma skills
37:33 - it is violent but no more violent than what you might see on television except that some of these
37:39 - ghouls do possess extraordinary abilities like the kindred who created them
37:45 - they're a lot stronger they're a lot tougher and they are a lot faster
37:50 - so the fights are too nice
38:01 - you look like you went somewhere just a moment ago oh don't worry about me it's been
38:06 - [Music] a night yes oh has it
38:12 - yeah you know only so much time to fit everything that we need to do into one evening
38:20 - so tell me what kept you all so
38:25 - entertained this evening
38:31 - we have a territory a little south of here and you know
38:37 - maintenance oh first territory yeah adorable you never forget the first
38:49 - what about you have you been here all night
38:55 - i come and go as i please but it sounds like you
39:02 - both may have had some trouble oh no trouble nothing we couldn't handle
39:11 - okay we're just looking to unwind after a stressful night of
39:18 - land boarding landlording you call it
39:24 - land look i haven't come up with like a sexy cool name so if you're pitching i'm listening
39:30 - landlording implies a certain amount of inequality
39:36 - yeah it's better that you take care of the
39:41 - people underneath you mortal or not
39:47 - landlords don't do that olatu makes the point
39:55 - i think margot just kind of like sinks and just watches the fight and kind of disengages a little bit
40:05 - where do you reside generally why
40:11 - interested in finding out where i do reside possibly also just curiosity
40:18 - you'd be hard-pressed to find a borough in the city that i don't have an apartment or mention or whatever
40:24 - there sounds nice they're lovely for my people yeah
40:32 - they are i have quite a few luxuries i get to indulge in
40:41 - i share it with them comes with experience i suppose
40:46 - experience no comes with ping willing to take a risk
40:55 - a smart one anyway after all
41:00 - i was not embraced far before youtube
41:06 - really hmm how long's it been that's privileged information but you
41:12 - two are so adorable i can't help but want to share five years
41:20 - so close okay
41:27 - i don't know if we're supposed to ask or not um can i ask what clan you are
41:35 - you can't tell some of us wear it so honestly
41:42 - all of it's very new it's okay i'm the one that asked questions
41:49 - now no [ __ ] i suppose if you want to give me an
41:54 - affiliation the ministry
42:02 - hey like look instinctively over and then get quiet okay that sounds incredible
42:10 - it sounds a lot more clerical
42:15 - and the way i run my own business is
42:20 - but if i'm to name a clan it is them
42:26 - okay do you like it
42:31 - are we talking about work now [Laughter] apparently so
42:40 - why do you ask you're not like i'm just making what you do what do you not like what you do i'm
42:48 - fresh in the field so you know running errands for richter and whatnot
42:56 - it's a good gig if you can get it is it well we all have to start somewhere
43:04 - there are much better ways to start my dear and what would you suggest
43:16 - making your own way in the city without anyone being able to hold you
43:26 - hmm an intriguing proposition easier said than done though
43:32 - for some but others have my help don't they
43:39 - and what kind of help do you offer now that is an answer you'll have to earn
43:46 - ah fuego oh yeah oh i'm surprised you think i'm
43:52 - still yeah okay what's up sorry there was a lot moment and i was like trying to turn invisible or whatever go ahead
43:59 - breathe it's okay i don't have to breathe sometimes it does help yeah okay
44:05 - don't tell me what to do ray as the fights move from ghoul to kindred
44:14 - again vampires you don't recognize some using power as you've never seen
44:19 - before you do notice money changing hands freely apparently there's a lot of side betting
44:26 - going on around here but there does seem to be a formal betting process
44:34 - the dj switches up the music to something a little bit more punky and frantic upstairs
44:40 - vampires down here into it seems to make the tempo of the fights faster
44:48 - serif hey hi
44:54 - you're in the band right yeah i'm francis what is poppin isn't
44:59 - that what you say here in the big apple did i get it right uh i don't say that
45:06 - so i doubt you should either okay uh you're not from around here then no
45:12 - i'm from l.a l.a oh
45:17 - okay you good what's that supposed to mean nothing i just oh something went down there i don't
45:23 - want to talk about it anyway whoa whoa whoa wait wait a second wait a second
45:29 - uh what have you heard something about free states honestly i don't care well i mean
45:37 - yeah um yeah i mean it's all it's all anarch
45:45 - it's all free i don't know if that's good or not it
45:50 - seems it seems vague at best i don't think they do either i mean
45:56 - there's a difference between freedom and autonomy they're not the same thing but
46:02 - many kindred think they are interesting
46:08 - you have the new turf yeah i do yeah how'd you hear about that
46:15 - yeah everybody hears everything around here eventually i guess so you you and your friends did
46:21 - something to the crowd the other night uh-huh did you like it yeah what was it
46:28 - it made him happy yeah
46:34 - what is it well do you know
46:40 - what i am um i don't know much about nothing so
46:49 - i'm what your friends might call thin blood okay
46:54 - that's a good thing i think well i guess it depends absolutely a good
47:00 - thing it's the best thing say no more best thing
47:05 - so but what was the thing that you did to the crowd oh um
47:12 - we thin bloods canada you know by now that all kindred have
47:17 - different gifts gifts of the blood some call it the gifts of cain you saw
47:24 - one of mine yeah do you know about the story of cain
47:33 - huh anyway
47:38 - thin bloods some of us we can um we call it a lot of different things
47:44 - mojo mixology alchemy
47:49 - we can do stuff with our blood take a little blood
47:55 - you mix in some metal shavings maybe some coffee grounds
48:00 - maybe a little mortal blood too a little anti-freeze
48:06 - it you know stir in some uh maybe some potassium nitrate
48:12 - and then when it's ready drink it down you know what happens i can fly
48:18 - you can fly i can fly can't you fly i can leap
48:26 - different kind of flight yeah you uh you can mix your blood into stuff
48:33 - and it makes stuff i can
48:39 - i open up my backpack and i pull out a spray can could you mix it with this i've never done that before
48:46 - would you want to try
48:52 - let's do it wow okay you're an artist like me
48:58 - i am yeah you know i was checking out your uh your territory the other day oh yeah i
49:05 - stopped in for breakfast at the coffee shop okay you don't have to rub it in
49:11 - so you do know about us i heard something about it's true
49:18 - yeah you can still go out in the sun yes
49:25 - is it can you feel it still feels warm
49:32 - i love to go out on the balcony from wherever i'm staying or on the roof
49:38 - there's no balcony and watch the sunrise
49:44 - i feel it on your skin it's so beautiful serif how'd you get how did you get that one
49:50 - i don't know how it happens it just happens you got lucky
49:55 - maybe i'm also a thin blood which pretty much
50:01 - every other kindred hates i don't hate most people
50:09 - give it time yeah i think we should paint something okay
50:14 - see what happens it sounds fun doesn't it it does
50:21 - you uh you got goals you want to do things you want to make
50:28 - things happen uh-huh and your friends feel the same way
50:38 - you know i don't know you very well so i don't know if i feel like talking about my friends
50:44 - smart maybe later yeah maybe after we do some
50:49 - art projects yeah yeah maybe wow
50:55 - wow nosferatu oh look at him go oh what a punch oh ow
51:07 - that was short ray you pretty much got a handle on how this
51:13 - works it's making money if the seats were full it'd probably
51:18 - make good money yeah it's definitely not making money as efficiently as it could
51:24 - okay outside of the business side of this i'm
51:29 - just absorbing as much as i can of what other kindred can do what ghouls can do
51:38 - uh now that i seem to have one what uh
51:44 - i can expect from other kindred any information that i no longer have to
51:49 - ha ask isaac for just watching it all absorbing trying to catalog as much of it as possible yeah
51:57 - it's the boring side of uh any new venture but it's
52:02 - essential meanwhile back in the vip box one of the mortals
52:08 - that has uh finished his flute of champagne wraps his arms
52:15 - around you and asks for a kiss
52:21 - oh uh i no i'm good thank you
52:28 - they're friendly yeah but don't feel bad for rejecting them okay i don't feel bad
52:35 - about that good you're better than a lot of folks that come up here with me
52:41 - muslim oh i don't want to offend you by not partaking in your food
52:49 - pathetic so
52:57 - you look like you want something that's just his face
53:02 - but i don't know maybe nothing particularly on my mind although i am curious as to
53:11 - what you said about helping others find their
53:17 - own way well
53:23 - there are many paths to get to the same direction the same location
53:30 - some involve less suffering than others
53:35 - some involve more mine
53:41 - less suffering and squalor and wandering around like cockroaches
53:47 - begging for scraps interesting it sounds nice
53:54 - it really does this
53:59 - time you're in the fragility of not knowing where you
54:04 - belong it doesn't need to last forever
54:13 - believe me i know and just because
54:19 - a big old man says you need to listen to what they say
54:24 - doesn't mean you actually have to
54:33 - would love for you to go on you wouldn't you
54:39 - i have curiosities of my own do you i'm an open [ __ ] book
54:47 - i do love sarkozy it's one of my favorite indulgences i
54:53 - wouldn't call this sarcasm i just have met more kindred in the last week
55:01 - than i have in the last seven months and i have not known any of them
55:07 - to offer anything without a cost and i would love to do this forever
55:13 - because you're beautiful and wonderful and i'm having a great time same but again been a kind of a wild night so if we
55:20 - could cut the [ __ ] chase what do you need
55:25 - it's not a need i simply want to know more about you and
55:30 - your little cutery why
55:37 - the people who get embraced are some of the most interesting
55:45 - that unlife has to offer from the most interesting of what life had to offer
55:51 - someone chose you for a reason
55:58 - and that's interesting that's gonna have to be something fielded by my good friend isaac
56:05 - because i have no good idea about why i was chosen thank you so much
56:11 - for the compliment i wasn't asking necessarily why i was pointing out a fact
56:19 - i'm simply interested in what you've been doing what you've been up to
56:24 - entertain me
56:36 - i think the most interesting thing that apparently according to the mortals that live in our territories there's a
56:43 - big monster living in our territory yeah bigger than all of you
56:50 - physically the same size but what were they talking about capitalism no
56:56 - not a metaphorical monster but an actual monster a little bit still capitalism fair
57:01 - but what is this monster supposedly well we're not exactly sure yet we've
57:07 - only caught a glimpse of it and it is supposedly
57:13 - catching people when they're on their own and devouring them whole just like in the story
57:21 - so eventually we have to find out what's doing it and put an end to that
57:27 - if we are to protect the people who are underneath us
57:32 - i necessarily paint you with someone who gets her hands dirty
57:37 - can you tell from what i'm wearing yeah truly pristine
57:43 - listen you don't get to be where i'm at without getting your manicure ruined once in a
57:49 - while but i have people to take care of most of
57:55 - that for me and how do you get people nothing go ahead no no ask
58:04 - how just how i'm having some interpersonal struggles
58:10 - are you now what kind maybe i can help oh no sweetie
58:16 - it's okay um just how do you cultivate
58:23 - whatever the [ __ ] you've got going on because it feels like you got your [ __ ] together and i love that for you and would love
58:30 - that for me realistically
58:38 - it's that those who follow me those
58:43 - who have access to my compounds those who offer you a kiss
58:49 - so speak love me and adore me
58:56 - and i take care of them
59:01 - whether mortal ghoul or kindred
59:09 - and sometimes you know you run against
59:14 - someone who wants to make that a problem and i make it in their best interest
59:22 - for it not to be
59:28 - so sarah if i'd like to meet your friends you want to meet my friends yeah
59:34 - why are you so keen to meet my friends i like your turf
59:39 - oh you got some nice balconies and i kind of like permission to you know come and
59:44 - go as i please i won't eat anything i mean i'll eat breakfast
59:54 - okay um you know what all right fine yeah i'll
59:59 - introduce you to my friends but cool only if you help me with this first help you with the paint the art project
1:00:06 - yeah wow okay ooh we're at the bargaining stage already huh we just met
1:00:13 - i mean i mean who's your your friend there in the suit who keeps you know you know watching the fights and looking
1:00:19 - at all the money and he's got like you know brain like an abacus you can tell you like you like him i didn't say that
1:00:26 - you want to talk to him you want to be friends with him i'll tell you what what do you recommend what
1:00:31 - do i recommend yeah for him no who should i talk to oh great question
1:00:38 - i mean sarah you got to be in charge you got to be in charge of your uh
1:00:45 - of you it's a great opportunity i can do stuff
1:00:50 - that you want access to i'm trying to learn about the kindred
1:00:56 - in the area you're in the driver's seat here you know it was good it was it was it was a good
1:01:03 - opening right you do this for me first then i'll do something for you but you kind of lost it so
1:01:09 - come on i mean it's like my uh it's like my friend lizzy always says
1:01:15 - claim your crown or claim your grave fine
1:01:21 - and i grab him by the collar and i uh drag him over to the vip section where
1:01:28 - margot and isaac are and i drop him
1:01:33 - you hauled him bodily over here he doesn't resist as you drop him
1:01:39 - unceremoniously into the vip area which seems like an excellent place
1:01:45 - to briefly pause our vampire story for now
1:02:06 - hey everyone i'm yev uh here from new york city now uh victor sent me out here to do some tech work for a friend of his
1:02:13 - i haven't quite met up with them yet but uh but either way very exciting to be sent on location now back to the blazing
1:02:19 - uh big apple as they call it lots of fun things about the uh the big apple uh it's got it's got apples uh they're huge
1:02:26 - uh the nice thing about it is i tend to retain my memory out here back on the west coast uh
1:02:32 - i would lose entire days uh which was super strange uh and very weird uh but
1:02:38 - victor never seemed to be bothered by that in my memory lapses so that was good uh didn't affect my employment uh
1:02:44 - which is great uh love everything about it uh i guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the big apple uh i'm
1:02:51 - i'm helping some of his friends uh at least i'm supposed to be hopefully soon uh when they reach out but um i wanted
1:02:57 - to to tell you uh the same thing that i'm gonna tell them which is if you go to backblaze.com
1:03:04 - ny by night that's n-y-b-y-n-i-g-h-t you can start a free trial of backblaze
1:03:10 - we'll back up everything on your computer some movies photos music videos contracts covenants
1:03:17 - i don't know things that are important to fancy business people like victor and i'm sure everyone out there as well and
1:03:23 - you'll have a copy of it available to you wherever you are maybe on your computer maybe on your phone maybe on your other mobile devices
1:03:32 - ipads i don't know something anyway go to backblaze.com ny by night

1:11:02 - hello and welcome back to our vampire the masquerade chronicle
1:11:07 - new york by night season one episode 6
1:11:13 - when i am hungry we return to the pit
1:11:20 - in the deepest part of the cage where francis the thin blood guitarist from the band
1:11:26 - bronx cheer has been dragged by his collar across
1:11:33 - the room and dumped unceremoniously into the vip box
1:11:39 - hey you weren't oh was that absolutely necessary yes it was he stands up and glares at you i'm sorry but
1:11:46 - were you under the impression that this was the trash bin sorry
1:11:52 - how dare you he just really wanted to meet me oh sweetheart
1:12:00 - shoot
1:12:10 - i'll remember i hope so
1:12:18 - he stares at you like he is trying to memorize your features too
1:12:23 - i'd like to activate something hmm what would you like to try entrancement oh my
1:12:31 - the big guns are coming out hmm
1:12:38 - first things first grab a red hunger dye please roll it to rouse your blood and tell me
1:12:45 - what symbol comes up success you don't get any hungry or you
1:12:51 - keep your beast under control so for you the role is
1:12:57 - your charisma attribute plus dice equal to all your dots and
1:13:03 - presents so what is that seven dice eight eight dice
1:13:09 - one of which is your red hunger die roll for francis not his best role here
1:13:20 - that is three successes not sure why i bothered all right
1:13:28 - the retort dies on his lips and
1:13:33 - you can feel the familiar sense of emotional triumph
1:13:39 - as his heartstrings tug invisibly in your direction
1:13:44 - darling small play later
1:13:52 - anything to make you happy that's what i love to hear i'll see you
1:13:58 - later bye he turns almost like a sleepwalker
1:14:06 - and wanders out of the pit i would prefer
1:14:12 - if you didn't bring a riffraff to where i sit i am so sorry
1:14:18 - lovely to see you again though good to see you as well thank you again last time for the refreshments
1:14:24 - i won't i'm sorry don't be it's an entertaining diversion
1:14:31 - i aim to please now there is an important question that i didn't ask any of you
1:14:39 - that i feel i should ask now are
1:14:44 - you hungry
1:14:52 - i could eat i'm okay i'm okay thank you thank you
1:14:58 - never let me say i not hospitable it's very important
1:15:03 - extremely i knew you'd understand
1:15:08 - now i believe we were having a conversation about what can be done to
1:15:16 - not be a service rat is that yeah
1:15:22 - yeah what's happening with you ray keep on trying to uh
1:15:28 - watch a little bit more keep getting distracted by the uh ruckus
1:15:34 - from the uh vip um area until i finally look over and realize
1:15:41 - that it's the three of them up there so i'm gonna make my way that way
1:15:47 - wow let's have you arrive hey so this is what all of you are doing
1:15:55 - we're all together again oh yes the bonds between the codery
1:16:03 - how lovely to see you again a pleasure
1:16:11 - we were just discussing very briefly
1:16:17 - the difference between running around serving others
1:16:24 - and having power over yourself and what you do
1:16:34 - sounds like a touchy subject from the change in demeanor
1:16:41 - well i think it's i think it ends up being a little more
1:16:47 - complicated in what way
1:16:52 - do tell it's very easy to say that you don't want to do something that someone
1:16:58 - says they want you to do or at least tell yourself that
1:17:04 - but doing what you want doesn't mean
1:17:09 - not doing what others want
1:17:15 - getting what you want doesn't mean defying others
1:17:22 - no not necessarily but there's no reason why
1:17:29 - you need to suffer needlessly
1:17:35 - to feel in control of yourself and what you do
1:17:45 - i think we all suffer a little needlessly but that's the
1:17:52 - new life that we lead right no actually that aspect of life is not new
1:17:59 - unlife or otherwise or tell me did you not work in service of a rat race when you are living
1:18:07 - oh believe me believe me i worked unlife is no different
1:18:13 - you might have an eternity but you're still scrambling around for the scraps
1:18:18 - that those above you give you you realize that don't you
1:18:24 - all of you yeah coming to terms with it
1:18:32 - let me tell you something everyone
1:18:37 - who serves me for lack of a better term
1:18:46 - has the power to choose i don't keep any of them with me out of force
1:18:52 - or even fear they come willingly because i
1:18:59 - give them what they need it's true it's true one of the mortals
1:19:04 - in the box reaches up a hand to stroke your suit
1:19:09 - sleeve ray it's absolutely true ask for consent first
1:19:14 - you know the rules i'm sorry yeah get the [ __ ] off me
1:19:20 - [ __ ] officer now
1:19:25 - i bet you want to know how you achieve that or how i've achieved that
1:19:32 - most people do but it's actually quite simple
1:19:42 - i was turned for the positions that i had in life
1:19:47 - the connections that i had in life to be a tool
1:19:56 - and i very quickly proved i'm no one's tool
1:20:03 - i'm the [ __ ] hammer everything else is a nail
1:20:10 - or a fellow hammer
1:20:16 - and that's what i offer my people
1:20:23 - autonomy and yes do i get something from it
1:20:28 - absolutely but so do they all of them
1:20:36 - it's been a mutually beneficial relationship yeah life's real simple when you forget
1:20:42 - about the carpenter [Laughter] oh i don't forget
1:20:48 - everything that i do is dealing with how to keep myself
1:20:54 - and my people happy
1:21:00 - and if not happy able to choose
1:21:09 - which is not necessarily something i feel all of you have had
1:21:16 - realistically i find it so funny that for all the talk of freedom
1:21:24 - that anarchs do which i suppose includes me
1:21:29 - how much different is it really from the camarilla if you're just running out around at the
1:21:35 - behest of some baron or underling
1:21:41 - well i think that's something that we can agree on
1:21:46 - the only difference between the anarchs and the camarilla is that the camarillas seem to play by
1:21:53 - stricter rules rules are good
1:21:58 - rules mean that someone else is beholden to something it's easier to play around can also be
1:22:08 - threats confinement
1:22:15 - it's very easy when your opponent's confined
1:22:20 - all you have to do is outthink them
1:22:26 - you truly were in business weren't you um yeah jealous
1:22:32 - i have a different boss these days though how do you like them he [ __ ] sucks hmm
1:22:40 - that's what i thought listen
1:22:46 - i will tell you this and offer this advice to each and every one of you
1:22:52 - you have an eternity don't spend it the same way you lived
1:23:01 - in squalor running around for paycheck
1:23:07 - whatever that paycheck may be
1:23:13 - be a waste
1:23:25 - well thank you this has all been very informative i appreciate your advice on the
1:23:31 - situation and you're right the definition of rules can get a little murky
1:23:38 - always it can always be a little murky
1:23:46 - now i find you all rather interesting
1:23:54 - tell you what she'll snap to one of the ghouls
1:24:00 - give them my card at once that card has my personal number on it
1:24:08 - and the location of one of my compounds the card is the same color
1:24:15 - is simone's hair tonight i grab that in fact it might actually be
1:24:23 - filigreed with real gold
1:24:28 - that's my compound and pelham feel free to stop by if you want to see
1:24:35 - what rebellion can look like with a little bit of style
1:24:42 - thanks no problem
1:24:48 - last match of the night i'm gonna get up and uh start making my way that way and
1:24:55 - as i leave i'm gonna say you know what i'm gonna take a little bit of your advice
1:25:02 - i'm gonna go have a conversation with my boss i'm gonna head down to the pit
1:25:09 - down into the pit yeah whoever is lining up for this fight
1:25:17 - i only need one of them to walk in and i'll push the [ __ ] other one aside so
1:25:23 - ray essentially forces his way into the fighting ring over the rail
1:25:30 - the nosferatu who won the earlier match by dislocating something horrific from his
1:25:35 - opponent turns around says
1:25:41 - don't think he's supposed to fight you he's
1:25:46 - got his arms twice as long as they should take your jacket thank you very much it won't be a fight but
1:25:53 - broad shoulders heavily muscled his jaw is distended a bit forward and
1:26:00 - rather than fangs he seems to have curving tusks from his lower lip
1:26:06 - hmm okay there's no referee
1:26:14 - are you sure i mean where we're still up in the box aren't we no i followed him down okay i grabbed his jacket when he took it off
1:26:21 - he's not going to do well i think your friend is going to do
1:26:28 - are you sure i know what i'm doing
1:26:34 - hmm good luck as i said there's no referee
1:26:41 - the rules are a little unclear in fact no one has told you what they are so perhaps there are none
1:26:49 - i've been watching closely i know when the uh crowd cheered when they booed
1:26:55 - what seems to be frowned upon doesn't seem like much is frowned upon
1:27:00 - no all tactics seem to be viable no one has made been put into
1:27:07 - the final what did i what did i see happen to the losers
1:27:12 - some of them merely gave up surrendered others
1:27:18 - fell into what you've heard called torpor a state of comatose unconsciousness
1:27:24 - which is difficult to be roused okay
1:27:33 - the crowd is excited the dozen or so kindred gathered around start exchanging
1:27:40 - some serious money this fight's not on the books this is something new something fresh did he
1:27:46 - put money on his fight i didn't see him do it did you put money on this fight nope
1:27:53 - that's not what this is about
1:28:00 - add your composure to your awareness and what is the total
1:28:05 - because that's your initiative it can't be composure to awareness yes
1:28:11 - oh good on a scale of a lot
1:28:16 - that's a two mm-hmm okay well you have the disadvantage
1:28:21 - the nosferatu will move first he's apparently going to rely purely on strength and reach he doesn't move
1:28:28 - terribly quickly in fact his legs which are much much shorter than his arms on top of his square torso kind of shuffle
1:28:36 - can i say that i activated toughness coming into this i think that is
1:28:43 - that you did and i don't get hungrier from it you don't get hungrier
1:28:50 - okay so here we go
1:28:56 - he lunges forward arms out stretch trying to land a blow will you dodge or will you fight back
1:29:03 - try and dodge you're gonna try to dodge out of the way okay so his pool is strength and brawl
1:29:10 - your pool um dexterity and athletics
1:29:16 - okay i'll add his hunger
1:29:21 - i need to make a rouse check
1:29:26 - his tusk jaws open and you think if he could salivate he
1:29:32 - would so three successes
1:29:37 - best you'll failure best job failure may i cut in
1:29:42 - multiple things happen at once simone can do whatever she wants
1:29:50 - i can and i always do this one
1:29:55 - is interesting i'll hit
1:30:01 - big boy with eyes of the serpent oh you want to catch his eyes as he's
1:30:07 - fighting drag them to you and use that power
1:30:12 - very well ray you have a couple of choices
1:30:20 - you can of course spend willpower re-roll
1:30:26 - and try to get enough dice to meet or exceed
1:30:32 - history successes one of those is always going to be a hunger though i don't have enough of my pool to what's your total
1:30:38 - pool three so they'd all have to be successes mm-hmm well with one being i can't
1:30:44 - re-roll the uh can't rule the hunger die so that leaves you with two more choices
1:30:52 - vestil failure you could of course
1:30:58 - just go with it ride it out let the beast have its way
1:31:04 - see what happens you could also spend
1:31:09 - when it will power take temporary willpower damage to keep possession of yourself
1:31:17 - and be rey for one turn and get to direct your frenzy
1:31:25 - which would you prefer i'm gonna spend the will power
1:31:31 - spent a point of willpower now normally with the bestial failure
1:31:36 - sometimes it activates a compulsion sometimes it results in increased hunger
1:31:43 - or loss of damage to attributes in this particular case
1:31:50 - i think the compulsion of the gangrel is more fitting so
1:31:57 - roll all your unspent willpower
1:32:12 - zero successes you return
1:32:17 - to a feral state rey's eyes become huge
1:32:25 - lightness like a shark's eyes you see
1:32:31 - his skin around his neck begin to change
1:32:37 - along his arms where he's rolled up his sleeves and instead of hair
1:32:43 - skin you see tiny glistening
1:32:49 - armor-like scales come on and suddenly
1:32:54 - in his mouth where once there was just a pair of fangs like all of you there's a lot of teeth
1:33:04 - interesting eyes of the serpent grab some dice you have i believe eight
1:33:11 - to roll two injured roll his willpower
1:33:17 - to see if he meets your gaze [Applause]
1:33:24 - that is two successes well he rolled absolutely zero on his willpower
1:33:32 - so he met the gays two successes hmm
1:33:40 - let's see here what will he do
1:33:53 - because he's in the middle of a fight and he's about to be
1:33:58 - savagely attacked i'm going to take a die out of his pool
1:34:05 - he doesn't have a discipline that will help him to hunger
1:34:11 - not a great role for him to success is a tie but the active
1:34:17 - kindred always wins so anyone who can see or is watching
1:34:24 - simone's own eyes change they become yellow and the pupils transform into vertical
1:34:32 - slits like a snake or a serpent and the nosferatu who seems about to
1:34:39 - grab rey by the neck and squeeze simply
1:34:44 - stops emit attack and simply
1:34:49 - stares goodbye little lamb
1:34:56 - you've spent a point of willpower you've taken superficial will tower power damage you have a turn you can do one
1:35:02 - action you can choose it before the beast does what is it to be
1:35:09 - that dodge is to sidestep to
1:35:15 - back around behind this guy just so that when i let go i can [ __ ] drain
1:35:20 - him because he is paralyzed and he is
1:35:27 - unable to move he isn't even aware that you have changed your position in the ring
1:35:34 - so what happens when you get behind him i
1:35:39 - leap onto his back and sink every tooth i have
1:35:48 - into the back of his neck the crowd erupts with a roar of approval
1:35:56 - [Music] does anyone want to step in
1:36:04 - do you think or look away or leave i'm gonna step in
1:36:11 - you're gonna get into the ring yeah well from where you are
1:36:19 - it's within a soaring leap i'm gonna use soaring leap
1:36:28 - you jump clearing the heads of the audience easily
1:36:34 - almost catch your foot on the railing as you go over but not quite you meant to do that
1:36:40 - totally looks like you meant to do that you stick the landing
1:36:45 - what happens then i want to try and get them off you want to try to intervene
1:36:50 - multiple more things happen at once let's recall that rey is in frenzy
1:36:57 - and unless he spends willpower he has no control over what he's doing he cannot tell friend from fall
1:37:04 - meanwhile the nosferatu of course is paralyzed some of the crowd
1:37:11 - decides this isn't cool it's not fair and they too
1:37:17 - come over the rail and jump in the ring to help you whatever the rules of the fight are
1:37:24 - they've decided they've been broken others
1:37:30 - just wait for it like romans with the gladiatorial arena of
1:37:36 - old isaac anything still standing in the box next to
1:37:43 - margo no michael's down aren't you you're near you're at the railing holding ray's coat
1:37:51 - uh if i see sarah running i'm gonna jump in and i'm gonna try to get eye contact
1:37:58 - to try to mesmerize right so ray the shark-like maw full of teeth
1:38:06 - finds kindred flesh there's a crunch of bone there's a rush of vitae
1:38:15 - it's not immortal that you're drinking it's a vampire a fellow kindred the blood tastes
1:38:22 - different just as good
1:38:28 - but it carries with it powerful emotions anger
1:38:34 - fear loss despair and excitement
1:38:41 - all these rush through your mouth and down your throat and into
1:38:46 - your body suffusing the essence of what you are
1:38:52 - with all those emotions at once the beast loves it and just snarls
1:38:59 - in triumph it howls in ecstasy inside your head
1:39:07 - serif strength and brawl
1:39:13 - i appreciate your help in this situation what happens when you look at rey's eyes and he looks
1:39:19 - at yours he doesn't seem to even recognize you
1:39:26 - what do you wish to do serif how many successes one success one success
1:39:32 - do you how many dice are in your pool two do you want to uh spend willpower to get two successes
1:39:38 - it's not guaranteed to do more once one's my hunger day so i can't re-roll it
1:39:44 - so ray are you gonna continue spending
1:39:50 - willpower to master yourself only if i see
1:39:58 - serif jumped in yes yeah if she's
1:40:04 - if she is in danger i'm spending that will power to
1:40:10 - i think statistically speaking there is a one in one chance that she is in danger
1:40:17 - and that's where that will power's going okay to try and shove her away not
1:40:24 - attack but push her away do you want to give up your bite
1:40:29 - and grip on your victim no
1:40:34 - you grab one of his arms and hold it he's trying to push you away trying to
1:40:40 - shove you back but he doesn't want to relinquish his grip on the nosferatu
1:40:48 - what happens when rey meets your eyes i know i'm not looking at rey
1:40:55 - but whatever i am looking at is powerful and i want to bring it to heel
1:41:02 - so can i search and then try to mesmerize the rouse check
1:41:08 - oh jesus you get hungrier
1:41:14 - hmm what are we wasting our time for here
1:41:22 - shouldn't you be up in the vip box with your new friend drinking your fill from one of her
1:41:28 - friends and living the unlife of luxury that you deserve
1:41:34 - what is all this i want whatever that is
1:41:39 - you can have it but you won't find it here in the arena you'll find it there where she is
1:41:46 - what a waste of time
1:41:53 - by this point the attack the pain the anguish
1:41:58 - and the fear has yanked the nosferatu out of the hypnotic gaze that you
1:42:05 - imposed but the tactic you employed worked pretty well
1:42:12 - he's not going to get out of the script without help isaac was it yes
1:42:20 - do you think your friends have this under control no they have nothing under control most of
1:42:27 - the time then are you asking for my further
1:42:32 - assistance my dear no what happens to them will happen to them
1:42:38 - they will either learn to not be a mess or they won't and they need the lesson either way and he will leave
1:42:45 - the box and head down you will make your way at a leisurely pace yes
1:42:54 - back in the arena how many unspent willpower do you have
1:43:00 - left one
1:43:08 - fury friendly only ends when the threat or the target is eliminated
1:43:16 - or the compulsion is satisfied
1:43:23 - if you want to spend that last point of willpower
1:43:29 - you can master yourself for one turn i will make you a devil's bargain
1:43:37 - if you will take a point of aggravated willpower damage
1:43:44 - you can end the frenzy since your victim is largely helpless and no threat to you
1:43:57 - or can continue
1:44:03 - i'm gonna use all the strength i have in me
1:44:09 - to fight this thing and that thing is my beast i'm gonna use
1:44:16 - that willpower yeah fully mark out one of your willpower
1:44:22 - boxes you
1:44:27 - injure your own will to prove that you are
1:44:35 - reyes malcolm and now you're a beast
1:44:40 - the crowd is disappointed when your frenzy ends and your features begin to change
1:44:48 - back into more familiar form sir if you still got a hold of his arm
1:44:56 - mario is still here the nosferatu has begun too back away
1:45:02 - and holding a hand to it he's still conscious you know sort of
1:45:10 - all right i don't need your [ __ ] help
1:45:16 - the other kindred in the pit who jumped over the rail to stop at her surrounding you get a hold of yourself
1:45:22 - what this isn't what you came to see she's cheating she helped you
1:45:30 - i sure as [ __ ] didn't ask her to and i didn't ask you two either
1:45:37 - i leave you exit theory now i run off
1:45:43 - head out upstairs
1:45:48 - seeing that nosferatu is not permanently damaged
1:45:53 - the other kindred the observers begin to calm down everybody decides it's probably time to
1:45:59 - call the fights for the evening
1:46:05 - your eyes have finally returned to their normal state your skin
1:46:11 - doesn't have any more of those diamond sharp little hard scales
1:46:17 - and your fangs are what they're supposed to be
1:46:28 - simone is going to come down from the vip box alone people make
1:46:34 - room for you people and kindred also
1:46:39 - i was going to use clear the field but that works do you want to make it more dramatic yes absolutely clear the field it is
1:46:47 - so without so much as needing to twitch a muscle
1:46:53 - you employ a particular presence power you do need to make
1:47:00 - a rouse check for hunger though failure
1:47:07 - that soft sibilant voice that you so love sounds
1:47:13 - in your mind i hope we will be satisfied
1:47:19 - hello beasty we'll be fine we
1:47:25 - think you'll be tasty can we have a sip
1:47:32 - later business first let's make this a
1:47:38 - general reaction
1:47:43 - and uh let's see for you it's uh composure and presence again
1:47:52 - can i activate unswayable mind when she starts moving absolutely and am i caught in this as well
1:47:59 - let's see what the role is
1:48:06 - five successes five successes so it's not directed well it's an area of
1:48:13 - effect power so all the kindred and ghouls between
1:48:19 - simone and the arena move out of her way it's like watching the c part in one of those
1:48:25 - old-time movies they simply step aside for her
1:48:30 - allowing her to descend down the bleachers at her leisure
1:48:37 - i want to gently interpose myself between simone and ray as she comes down
1:48:45 - and if i am caught in this i would like to make it a point to use
1:48:51 - my willpower to stop myself from moving for just a moment and then consciously step
1:48:58 - aside take a point of superficial willpower damage to remain in control of yourself
1:49:08 - and then you can move to one side
1:49:14 - most of the other kindred who were affected by your power have decided
1:49:20 - someplace else would be the better place any place else would be a better place to be now that's why and they have begun
1:49:25 - to leave the pit there's a white handkerchief in the
1:49:32 - inside pocket of my jacket yeah go to fuego grab that
1:49:38 - clean as much of the blood off of my face as i can you okay
1:49:44 - you started the fight with how many hunger one well you still got one
1:49:53 - i uh i lost that fight there'll be other fights
1:50:03 - i asked if you were okay
1:50:08 - just helping them wait on when it counts
1:50:14 - okay consuela appears in the doorway of the
1:50:20 - arena well what a way to end an evening you
1:50:28 - miss simone shoe i don't think so now
1:50:33 - my club my rules
1:50:39 - you may be queen of the night but you're not necessarily queen of this night
1:50:45 - entrancement entrance
1:50:50 - hmm let's see here the disciplines are flying fast
1:50:56 - check it's your charisma and presence again um
1:51:02 - succeed yeah
1:51:10 - three successes four
1:51:16 - four successes she will spend a will power to re-roll the failed dice
1:51:25 - and she still loses so consuela
1:51:31 - your treasure i'm told i am some treasures
1:51:37 - need to be buried shoe

1:52:25 - that that was not the point you meant to prove
1:52:31 - no but i'll get it right one of these days
1:52:37 - remember you can always learn from failure
1:52:46 - serif where do you go you know i run up the to the first floor
1:52:52 - of the base floor i think i'm trying to find francis he's hanging out
1:52:57 - he's on the dance floor just chilling grooving to the tunes
