# Season 1 Episode 7 - A Thing With Fangs

### WIP- current captions directly ripped from youtube.

0:01 - hello good evening and Welcome to our vampire

0:06 - the Masquerade Chronicle New York by night

0:11 - We are continuing our story about four fledgling anarch vampires in the borough

0:19 - of the Bronx in New York City this evening with season one episode seven

0:26 - a thing with fangs

0:31 - we're going to change things up this evening we're going to take a look at each

0:37 - member of this codery one at a time and explore something important and

0:43 - unique to each of their stories now before we do let's thank a few

0:48 - people let's thank dogmite games for giving us this beautiful New York City

0:53 - skyline Storyteller screen and player dice boxes

0:58 - let's thank Renegade game studios for making sure that our hunger dice never

1:04 - run out we'd like to thank back Blaze

1:10 - cloud storage service that keeps your data protected even from the Sabbat and remember

1:18 - yev is canon and finally we'd like to thank

1:23 - Blackmagic design for these fantastic cameras and their support equipment that

1:28 - brings us to you in unliving color

1:36 - as we look at each of these individual characters this evening

1:42 - I encourage you to consider this so many fledglings and neonates in the

1:48 - world of Darkness are effectively free radicals unstable compounds that

1:57 - are looking for a home trying to survive the nightly dangers and challenges without much of a long-term plan of

2:04 - where to hunt or how to sleep during the day or really what to do

2:09 - and that works sometimes for a while until it doesn't and then come the

2:17 - difficult choices the devil's bargains

2:23 - we've also been reminded frequently in the story that every vampire has

2:29 - their Beast but every vampire has the opposite

2:35 - a human voice inside them now the Beast wins sometimes

2:41 - that doesn't quiet the human voice the voice that warns of guilt or that cries

2:48 - out in fear of what could be lost and struggles against that downward spiral

2:55 - the human voice can be more powerful than the voice of the Beast

3:01 - but only if the vampire lets themselves listen to it

3:07 - with this firmly in mind let's tell a vampire story

3:13 - yeah thank you

3:21 - [Music]

3:52 - thank you

4:01 - [Music]

4:13 - [Music]

4:27 - foreign

4:39 - we're on the cold dark streets South Bronx tonight

4:45 - we're in the coteries territory their domain

4:51 - Turf that they have received for the performance of services for the payment of rent

4:59 - and on one of these streets it's the atlas Shipping Company we're just across the street looking at

5:06 - it the building is a little more than a big rectangular shell rusting corrugated

5:13 - metal and chain link fencing faded paint stained concrete

5:18 - it's so non-descript it could almost be deliberately so and

5:23 - they could be doing absolutely anything inside

5:29 - a truck about the size of a big moving van with the company logo stenciled on it a huge bicep balancing in the world

5:38 - sits in the fenced off parking area and next to it a much nicer vehicle a

5:44 - silver gray sports car but there are no visible people

5:50 - in either vehicle a security guard walks a lonely beat around the building

5:57 - every few minutes trying to keep warm

6:03 - these gloved hands rubbing together we see his steamy breath in the night

6:10 - air he passes by this time

6:15 - and does not notice the vehicle parked across the street

6:21 - where are you sure this is it sir absolutely yes okay well

6:29 - doesn't look like much hmm well that might be the point

6:35 - um what do you want us to do

6:40 - well Michael you wait with the car and Angela and I are going to go

6:47 - and check it out you got it is the best plan

6:54 - I'll just sit right here I mean there's nothing conspicuous about a new super turbo fast minivan in this

7:01 - neighborhood or anything like that yes yes look um maybe drive around until we call

7:09 - if you if that's a better option yeah you got it sir thank you

7:17 - um yeah let's do this yes sir

7:24 - Angela is ready she has her equipment and weapons

7:29 - At Your Service as you leave the car she glances at you again for the third time

7:36 - this evening in a direct and peculiar fashion because there's something wrong

7:41 - um I just couldn't help wondering sir um did you uh

7:46 - I'm did you not find your clothes this evening no I just well different now I'm

7:53 - just being inconspicuous yes no one will notice

7:59 - but I have different clothes yes sir how do you want to do this sir did we

8:06 - what was the we had someone come and check this place out before didn't we did we get any red

8:12 - flags anything like that yes there are friends at the midnighters did as you asked and reckon ordered the property

8:19 - I talked to miss Monica and Mr CK

8:26 - they did not actually go inside the building Fair but they reported that uh

8:32 - there is infrequent activity it could very well be what it seems to be hey

8:39 - semi abandoned shipping company right or it might be something else we really don't

8:46 - know what's inside they did mention however sir that they could not detect

8:51 - anything in the way of an active security system well that makes that easier

8:56 - as you can see sir there are no security cameras just the wires and fittings where they were

9:02 - mounted so someone is very disinterested about being forewarned

9:09 - interesting a tactical error I think yeah considering what we are here to do

9:16 - well hopefully we can just walk in and get what we need and walk out um

9:21 - let's see now there are people here in the South Bronx Street

9:29 - most of them are walking purposefully and hurriedly trying to stay warm

9:35 - against the cold they walk in groups and singly back and forth

9:43 - it's not a heavily trafficked Street fortunately but it is certainly not

9:50 - devoid of life okay well I will

9:56 - is there a gate or is it just an open like parking lot hmm the chain link fence that surrounds the

10:02 - parking lot does have a gate it's one of those roll away right entrances

10:10 - I said well I will walk up to the gate and see if I can acquire the attention of the security

10:15 - guard before stepping inside you're bringing Angela with you yes well careful not to uh get hit by a car as

10:24 - you cross you find that the gate is unlocked there

10:29 - is a long chain and padlock wrapped around a post but it's not connected

10:35 - great getting the attention of the security guard is easy

10:41 - as he completes his next circuit

10:46 - he sees you excuse me hey can I speak to you for a second hey what do you want we're closed is no I

10:53 - know just I I have a question if you wouldn't mind coming here yeah yeah sure keep your shirt on all right all right

10:59 - no hurry um when he gets up to me I just I go I I make eye contact with him and say

11:05 - would you mind taking a break and I'm going to use Mesmerize I'm going to use Mesmerize well

11:12 - there's no role required Immortals have little to no effect no

11:17 - defense the only role required is of course the Rouse which I said I passed

11:22 - so I don't get hungry you are fine at least in terms of hunger so

11:30 - his eyes glaze over he checks his watch

11:35 - who checks their watch these days but he makes a big show out of it perhaps very proud of the expensive um

11:44 - Hardware of time keeping on his wrist yeah it's uh it's about time for uh for

11:51 - a coffee break right and if you don't mind don't tell anyone we were here hey suit

11:57 - yourself I mean there's not much going on tonight you know I mean uh

12:05 - you uh are you one of them yes

12:10 - yeah well uh you'll find him inside perfect um

12:16 - did he bring anyone with him what do you mean any friends anything like that no I see he's here by himself

12:23 - like usual great perfect I mean

12:30 - there's the boys the boys yeah you know the other guards

12:35 - oh how many how many more of you are there who showed up tonight let's see um

12:41 - I guess uh hey look at four or five I guess look I gotta go on break no that's fair that's very good go take your break

12:47 - Union rules yeah no absolutely yeah so um yeah um

12:53 - Tony's in there great you know actually um if you want to radio everyone

13:01 - nah never mind no that wouldn't work um yeah go take your break

13:06 - you want some coffee no I'm fine how about you miss you want some coffee she's fine as well

13:13 - hey um never mind you'll figure it out

13:21 - I gotta go okay he excuses himself and walks across the

13:28 - parking lot to the opposite side furthest away from the building and you can see now in the

13:35 - dark Shadows he's getting inside

13:40 - a little compact car did that seem ominous to you Angela ominous sir

13:47 - yes hmm so there's him here

13:52 - along with the boys and um seems like he's alone but there

13:57 - are other security so I said I'm going to suggest we do

14:03 - this quietly at least until we meet him

14:08 - yes sir whoever him is well

14:15 - do you want to use the front door sir or shall we seek another entrance

14:20 - um maybe see if there's a back entrance but that does possibly bring us into

14:27 - contact with more security but let's see what we can do straight in and pretend we know what

14:33 - we're doing then yeah sure why not it's worked before yes sir

14:39 - and we'll just walk towards the front door of the building

14:45 - front door is unguarded and it's unlocked

14:51 - great I'll go ahead and open it and step inside

14:57 - you find yourself in a very small cramped office

15:02 - filing cabinets a computer terminal an old metal desk

15:08 - storage shelves there is a door on the far side of the

15:13 - office it's got that frosted glass that doesn't allow you to see through

15:19 - but there is light coming through it and you can hear the sounds of activity on

15:24 - the other side of the door low voices the conversation seems muted and no one

15:32 - sounds excited about anything right but there is no one in this office to greet

15:37 - you answer them uh I'm gonna go step in the other office you stay in

15:43 - here sir in case anyone either comes in behind us or in case or until I call for

15:49 - you she removes her pistol perfect checks the action and

15:56 - positions herself in a corner where can she can see both the front door and the office door if um someone does

16:04 - come in looking for trouble maybe subdue them don't kill unless you

16:11 - have to but protect yourself very well sir all right and what is the signal in case

16:18 - you need me I'll just say your name yes sir

16:23 - so let's uh I'm gonna go towards the door and

16:29 - politely open it politely open the door rather than rudely open the door

16:36 - Beyond the Door is about what you'd expect to see from a shipping company

16:42 - a large open storage area with very little being stored in it

16:50 - on the very far side which you would call the back entrance away from the street there are a couple of wide garage

16:58 - roll-up doors that are closed and on the far wall stacked neatly a

17:04 - number of wooden crates and plastic containers with lids

17:11 - each and every one of them you can tell even from this distance is securely padlocked

17:18 - standing near those crates is it a group of people

17:24 - three of them are security guards dressed exactly like your friend from the parking lot right the other

17:32 - is wearing a designer sweater with a beautiful

17:37 - pattern on it slacks top coat and Eyeglasses which he keeps

17:44 - pushing up against the bridge of his nose as they don't fit quite right he's got some papers in his hand and

17:52 - he's gesturing at the crates and plastic boxes speaking to the security guards

17:57 - all of whom are doing their best not to look bored great not very successfully

18:04 - can I hear anything they're saying from here yeah um you can hear

18:10 - the well-dressed individual saying look I really don't care how many guys you

18:17 - have to bring in here it's all got to be gone get it done

18:23 - the boss wants this place empty and one of the security guards asks you

18:29 - know what about us what are we going to do don't worry you will be taken care of

18:34 - you'll be reassigned we have plenty of things that need your services

18:41 - okay one of the security guards has noticed you hey yes hello

18:49 - and in the designer sweater turns around and looks you

18:54 - who are you I'm here from the boss yeah I don't think so

19:00 - get this guy out of here the three security guards immediately start walking purposely towards you their

19:07 - shoes clattering against the concrete floor of the warehouse now none of them

19:12 - have drawn a weapon you're not even sure that they're armed once they get close enough to me

19:19 - I'm now if I were to dominate as a specific

19:25 - person-to-person thing because I don't have the power is that you possess certainly are specific yes working on

19:32 - individuals rather than a mass audience but theoretically I could do one at a time correct

19:39 - theoretically right I'll wait for them to

19:45 - get halfway between myself and the Man in the sweater as they close the distance

19:52 - one of them produces what looks like a collapsible baton from his belt and flicks it open

19:59 - hey you gotta get out of here buddy private property yes but I'm supposed to

20:05 - be here if you wouldn't mind stepping aside stepping aside that

20:11 - sounds like compel yes well no Rouse check required for compel

20:17 - and assuming this is an ordinary mortal yes it will function perfectly

20:24 - unfortunately is not an ordinary mortal interesting so please make a rule your

20:30 - pool is charisma and dominate and I will roll intelligence and resolve

20:41 - and one successful three successes three successes a margin of two

20:47 - his muscles seize up he never completes the forward motion

20:52 - that would have led to an attack instead take several paces and stands aside

20:58 - now the other two security guards noticed that he's done this and one of them clearly thinks he's Mr Q maybe he's

21:05 - not sure he hesitates third pays no attention and keeps walking straight towards you

21:13 - also using compelling still walking towards me join him

21:18 - once again

21:25 - two successes two successes Ty goes to the active character so

21:34 - the security guard hesitates even longer before

21:40 - obeying your command but in the end he too steps aside

21:48 - and moves over to join His companion I turned destructive I turned to the third one and using no power I say

21:55 - do I have to inform you as well you're not here from his boss or their

22:03 - boss's boss or whatever so why don't you just do us all a favor and get out of here

22:09 - sit down he never finishes what he was going to say next

22:19 - two successes three successes margin of one is enough he sits right on the concrete floor

22:27 - where he was standing he looks bewildered now of course

22:32 - these commands won't keep them where they are forever no

22:40 - this point the well-dressed individual on the far side of the warehouse has pulled out his

22:47 - cell phone his thumbs are busily moving over the

22:53 - electronic keyboard very slowly though is if he doesn't he's not really comfortable doing this before you send

23:00 - whatever message you're going to send I would like to have a conversation if that if you wouldn't mind

23:06 - he thinks about it for a moment I'm not here to hurt you he makes one final

23:13 - motion with his thumb and holds the phone to the side but he

23:18 - doesn't put it away okay you're not from the boss

23:24 - you even know who the boss is because if you did you wouldn't be here

23:31 - I'm sure I don't know who you are or what you are but I can assure you

23:38 - that if you hurt me things are going to go very badly for you I have no desire to hurt you

23:47 - well that's good yeah guess it's my lucky night it would seem what do you want I'm here

23:54 - for something specific and I would very much like to uh acquire it with no fuss and be able to go on my

24:00 - way well I hate to disappoint you but

24:06 - these things don't belong to you do they belong to you this place doesn't

24:11 - belong to you belongs to us that's fair

24:17 - now I don't believe the bones belong to you either considering you dug them up they

24:22 - were some they were buried in the ground have you never heard of Finders Keepers yes but I've also found them

24:29 - and I like to keep things look

24:40 - yes this is camarilla property oh

24:46 - you are messing with the wrong kindred sure I'm sure I am I'm always it seems

24:53 - every day every night I'm messing with something Kindred or another and I seem to have come out pretty well so far so

24:59 - far yeah you're about to mess with the bigger fish right um please if you wouldn't mind I'm

25:06 - growing a little tired so put down your phone

25:12 - hmm I'm gonna use mesmerize

25:17 - won't this be interesting

25:23 - forget the hunger diet two successes five five successes

25:35 - he doesn't put the phone down so much as he just lets it fall from his fingers

25:41 - and that's when he backs up and jumps on top of one of the taller wooden crates

25:46 - ready for a fight so I will walk over you can go first you

25:53 - are combined uh scores for initiative would be higher than his I walk slowly

25:59 - over go pick up the phone put it in my pocket he's produced a handgun while you were

26:06 - dealing with the phone please uh large pistol almost a little too big for

26:12 - his hand as he pulls the pistol I say look again

26:18 - I don't want to fight you but I can if you prefer that

26:26 - I don't really want to fight you either so let's not fight

26:31 - great something strange happens to his face

26:38 - a moment ago it was plain it's unassuming

26:44 - but somehow it's now different his eyes seem to take

26:50 - on a glittering ferocity that weren't there before pulls his lips back away so that you can

26:57 - see his fangs his shoulders square and he's some sort of

27:03 - Inner Strength he looks like he might actually mean business I'm going to give

27:10 - you one last chance before they get here and we string you up in Chains throw you

27:17 - on a roof would you please come in here yes sir

27:23 - so he's going to try to intimidate you great threatening you with

27:30 - Camarillo violence probably not terribly impressive to Isaac no but even so

27:37 - let's make the role um

27:43 - let's make a composure no better resolve since you are in fact on a mission and

27:52 - uh let's add your intimidation to it as well you're not trying to coerce him

28:07 - three successes six successes six successes double the margin like three

28:13 - you do not feel impressed by this display of

28:18 - threatening violence Isaac just looks him down stares him down says please and

28:25 - the claws just grow out of the tips of his fingers I don't want

28:32 - to hurt you so I am going to take this thing now

28:38 - and leave multiple things do happen at once you

28:45 - can hear footsteps evangela entering the warehouse from behind you

28:51 - and you can hear her say Hey you three don't move haven't killed anybody tonight don't

28:57 - want to start I but I will hear some murmured acquiescence from the

29:04 - security guards who were recovering themselves following your successful domination of their minds

29:13 - the vampire in front of you standing a few feet higher perhaps to improve his chances of

29:20 - intimidation on top of the crates looks Furious that he wasn't able to scare you off and yet he still has not

29:27 - opened fire with the gun even though he's got you at point-blank range

29:33 - and your feral weapons begin to grow except something is

29:39 - different normally of course there would be long

29:46 - attenuated claws dark in coloration

29:51 - deadly razor sharp but this time

29:58 - the finger bones themselves extrude from your fingertips

30:06 - you can see the white osseous substance

30:12 - elongating twice as long as the Pharaoh claws that you are

30:18 - accustomed to wield in moments of physical violence

30:24 - and each of the finger bones is covered in

30:29 - tiny little bone-like Spurs almost like the thorns on the stem of a rose

30:38 - and the vampire's eyes get very wide and if he had any place to go he would

30:47 - ah what are you special

30:53 - God you're one of them so just sit down quietly while I take this hurt you were

30:59 - back yeah we're back Mr Rafferty will find you if anything happens to me I look

31:06 - forward to speaking to Mr Rafferty I don't think you do

31:14 - which one of these has the captain's skull in it they've all got skulls and

31:19 - bones and crap at him how do I know

31:24 - why do you want them because I do

31:30 - and what I want I take

31:37 - okay we can make a deal great what is that deal

31:43 - I'd rather live through this night I would rather you live through this night he lowers the handgun to his side

31:55 - hit me okay I couldn't stop you right that makes

32:01 - sense but I tried right yes just don't kill me oh I won't

32:06 - and I um I take the hand with

32:13 - my new accoutrements and um

32:18 - I stick it into his right or his left pectoral

32:24 - muscle and I just throw him from the top of the crate

32:31 - it feels different of course than it would attack him with your normal feral weaponry

32:39 - better more organic

32:45 - he howls in pain loses his footing on the crate stumbles

32:51 - down to the concrete floor of the warehouse one hand clutched

32:57 - to his upper chest where you wounded him the gun clattering away on the floor

33:04 - oh God no

33:09 - he's starting to crawl away from you all right let's open these crates

33:16 - sir you need help might need a hand let's see what about

33:22 - these three hey lady we didn't see anything we don't know anything we we were never here

33:28 - great as long as they don't interfere I don't care oh [ __ ] man we don't get paid enough for

33:34 - this is different this is just new

33:40 - um okay uh yes let's go we need to find the skull that's why we're here

33:46 - um and I'm gonna these are all locked correct with padlocks that's correct okay I wonder and I'm going to take a

33:54 - slash at the Lock see if I can just break it off well yeah new osseous Weaponry that you

34:01 - are sporting let's find out let's make a

34:07 - um let's make it strengthen brawl but I

34:14 - want you to add an extra die that you wouldn't normally add right can do

34:26 - two successes it feels like a normal blow you don't

34:32 - feel like you've struck any harder than you normally would but the lock comes away

34:38 - from the wooden crate a hot knife going through butter could

34:43 - not have cut more cleanly she sweetness

34:49 - you have used security guards is there an inventory into which into what is in each crate send the desk

34:55 - which desk the desk I got it I'll get it I'll get it thank you

35:03 - a few moments later he comes trotting back with a Sheaf of papers

35:10 - looking through for a specific for trying to find the captain's skull hmm

35:15 - takes a moment or two to decipher the scribbled handwriting but

35:22 - with the Manifest you are able to determine that it's in one of the large plastic crates

35:30 - go to that one break the lock if necessary and search through it break the lock again using your

35:38 - feral weapons that have turned into bone spurs it's very satisfying to destroy things

35:45 - this way feels good yeah

35:51 - it feels right yes I

35:57 - Blended splendid you have made me so proud

36:04 - this is unusual this is a voice you do not normally hear except when the Beast

36:10 - rattles its cage inside you

36:16 - inside the plastic crate and there is a sort of wrapping or liner that is made

36:24 - out of synthetic fabric very thick very waterproof obviously designed to protect very carefully whatever is within

36:33 - and what is within is of course bones there is a skull

36:38 - there are several other bones that you think might be

36:44 - perhaps rib bones maybe a clavicle perhaps the humerus and

36:52 - various shards all darkened with age

36:58 - um Angela uh may I sir your hands yes I know hey I said don't

37:04 - move they flattened themselves back on the floor yes it's okay

37:10 - would you uh pass me your um my what uh bag did you have a bag with

37:17 - like a backpack or anything yes I I she takes the empty sack off her shoulder

37:22 - and hands it over it's fine are you all right sir perfect

37:27 - and I turn around and I just start stuffing all the bones into the bag it looks a little doubtful at your

37:34 - reassurance but she does as she is instructed

37:39 - sir are we staying no we're going to be leaving in just a moment

37:46 - and the um the staff

37:52 - yes I will deal with that put the bones in the bag and I turned to the Kindred who's on the floor he has

37:58 - crawled away and propped himself up against a wall he has also managed to

38:05 - retrieve and clutch in his hand the papers that he was holding when you first entered

38:11 - seeing your attention on him he quickly stuffs them into his trouser's pocket

38:17 - what are those they don't belong to you any more than the skull and the bones do we've

38:24 - established I don't care I can't believe this

38:29 - why don't you freaks just go back to where you came from The City Is Ours I don't want the city

38:36 - you can have it you realize the prince is going to hunt you down when she knows you're here

38:42 - sure you haven't met Kadir no I haven't

38:48 - I'm sure he's a monster like everyone else

38:54 - look I thought we had a deal we do I'm not going to kill you

41:08 - two successes three successes foreign

41:17 - this is the security guard who brought you

41:23 - the Manifest do I know he didn't succeed have no way of knowing whether or not the compulsion

41:29 - I should say right the mental compulsion or command has succeeded wonderful

41:36 - I bid you all a good evening let's go Angela hey um

41:50 - yeah us great well

41:56 - do you have a point of contact you're asking for my number

42:03 - sure if you need new jobs I changed my mind that's what I thought yeah good night

42:09 - good night and I walk out

42:15 - as he's walking out he looks at his hands and he

42:20 - he attempts to put them away like he would his feral weapons it's different

42:27 - but not more difficult to retract these Barbed bone weapons and in a few moments

42:37 - and ends are exactly as they were before Angela

42:42 - watches this with some consternation are you sure you're all right sir

42:49 - yes I I think I'm changing

42:55 - or learning I'm not sure isn't that a good thing sir I think so yes sir

43:02 - but I'm fine thank you for your that um concern

43:09 - that fellow probably got off at least one text message before we stopped him sir we should go yes yes I have his

43:15 - phone still um so we can't send any more but he most

43:20 - definitely told them someone was there but I would find I'm sure they'd be hard-pressed to discover who exactly it

43:27 - was let us get out of here as quickly as possible

43:32 - um I agree also ah

43:37 - as a side note I meant to mention this earlier it's not really important considering how this night is gone but

43:42 - um if a member of the cotery when we see them again

43:48 - should ask you any questions and I'll tell the same to Michael

43:54 - ask you any questions about your personal feelings or how you think things are going or your relationship to

44:00 - me go ahead and answer however you feel you don't need to ask me for permission

44:07 - sir it seems to make them uncomfortable that you ask so let's try and smooth that over as

44:14 - much as possible as you're leaving the building crossing the street

44:21 - heading back to the car Angela thinks about what you've said

44:28 - why wouldn't I ask you sir I work for you everything I have I owe to you yes but

44:35 - in the effort to make things more

44:40 - diplomatic and to run smoothly between the members of this code where we found ourselves in

44:46 - I think it would make them more comfortable and in terms of hospitality is

44:52 - their concerns whatever you say sir thank you Angela

45:00 - let's um Let's Take the Long Way Home I have some things to think about

45:06 - things to think about changes alterations

45:12 - possibilities as Michael

45:17 - pulls into traffic pointing the car northward

45:24 - headed for the expressway this seems an appropriate place

45:30 - to pause this vampire story for now

45:36 - Manhattan the most famous of the five boroughs of New York City

45:43 - we are in the financial district the southernmost part of the island

45:50 - this is the buzzing Financial heart of New York City and some might say

45:58 - of the country it's home to Wall Street and glittering skyscrapers that Loom above head

46:06 - blot out the night sky with their immensity during the day the sidewalks bustle here

46:13 - team with life at night after the banks and hedge fund investment firms

46:19 - are closed young professionals fill the restaurants and the bars of the South Street

46:26 - seaportana pedestrian only Stone Street above it all

46:32 - The Observatory at the top of one world train Center looking down

46:38 - over everything top of the world

46:44 - We Stand across the street from one of these buildings

46:51 - there are two polished metal doors

46:57 - with brass rivets and ornate medieval heraldric plaque attached to

47:04 - them the crest resembles something that one

47:10 - might find on a night's Shield but it's probably an absolute fabrication

47:18 - there is nothing to say what goes on behind those doors no other sign

47:25 - no lights but you Ray you know what happens inside

47:31 - because you've been here before New York City's wealthy are a special

47:38 - breed of rich as if owning a multi-million dollar hedge fund isn't Elite enough the city's

47:46 - wealthiest Power Players Finance these Havens

47:52 - to protect themselves from unwanted mingling with the rest of the city these guarded

47:57 - enclaves these private membership clubs offer every luxury and Immunity

48:09 - York City of course everybody's heard of the Union the Knickerbocker zero Bond the Yale

52:58 - and I'll go ahead and step out of the cab

53:06 - there are Mortals on the street impeccably well dressed

53:12 - business fashion some of them perhaps leaving the kind of office late a place where

53:19 - you were once welcomed with open arms in fact

53:25 - a place that you thought of as home they pay no attention to you

53:32 - as you cross the street and walk toward those guarded doors

53:37 - the security guards [Music]

53:44 - but they don't address you

53:49 - I'll head straight to the door

53:57 - he holds that his hand Palm up as if expecting something

54:03 - what uh you're waiting for a tip or you should move along sir members are

54:10 - you asking me to dance that is adorable members only sir

54:19 - my membership is do you can go ahead and tell them that Rey

54:31 - sir what's your full name Reyes Reyes Malcolm

54:37 - please wait here sir his compatriot steps over

54:44 - a pace to get directly in front of you so that he's between you and the doors

54:49 - while his associate enters I've seen you've graduated to senior

54:57 - door good job it's a living sir he is very very careful not to look you in the eyes but

55:05 - he always keeps you within his field of vision

55:10 - nice night sir hmm smells like I remember

55:20 - about two minutes later security guard who stopped you

55:27 - returns well you're not expected sir

55:35 - if you'd like to wait here for a moment someone will be out and just a short while

55:41 - good news rarely is expected but that's what I bring

55:50 - you wait um

55:55 - doesn't take long to Kindred emerge

56:03 - one of them you recognize lavash of the ventru clan

56:12 - his strong features dark thick hair

56:18 - not dissimilar to your own but younger when he was embraced

56:27 - and the other has an impeccably tailored suit

56:32 - a silk scarf that's more for show than for protection against the cold

56:39 - his necktie has a tie tack

56:45 - made out of precious stones and gems are more expensive than most luxury

56:51 - wrist watches the other you don't recognize at all

56:57 - and she doesn't look like she belongs here anymore than they think you don't

57:05 - she's very pale very slight and she's wearing dark clothing that could be best

57:12 - described as baggy she's also smoking a cigarette

57:19 - which is while not unknown among the Kindred a bit unusual her hair is thick

57:25 - and dark and you can see that she's made some attempt at it this evening but it's not

57:31 - holding up well she takes a long drag on the cigarette

57:37 - looks at lavash looks at you

57:42 - lavash smiles well well

57:48 - this is an unexpected pleasure um

57:54 - would you like to invite me in not particularly but you'd like to be invited in

58:00 - I very much would if I asked you what you were doing here Ray

58:06 - what would you tell me I would tell you that

58:12 - I've come to bring good news and prove that uh

58:17 - it's worth it to have someone like me around

58:23 - that's not my decision but um if I were so inclined

58:30 - yeah I could help you out things have changed since you left the borough really

58:37 - but why would I help you because I'm a changed man now you're not

58:42 - a man no none of us are no that's true but change has happened

58:48 - nonetheless lavash looks at the slight pale

58:55 - dark-haired Kindred next to him

59:03 - She Blows the Smoke Out she's good at she's clearly calling upon the power of

59:08 - the blood to let herself enjoy the nicotine and pretend to be alive

59:14 - her masquerade is excellent hey

59:19 - how you doing good just you're right yeah

59:26 - lavash says he knows you I

59:31 - didn't know we could do that which takes a long drag of the cigarette

59:36 - and blows the smoke up into the air so that it curls and Cascades into your

59:42 - face and then she offers you the cigarette I'll take a so

59:48 - you'll have to make a rouse check if you wish to attempt to smoke

59:54 - blush of life can't refuse hospitality

1:00:02 - success do you not get hungrier and this tiny spark of Fire doesn't seem to

1:00:10 - trouble your Beast significantly

1:00:15 - it's good it's imported whatever it is not the usual pack of cigarettes from the

1:00:21 - concession stand or the bodega my name's Julia

1:00:28 - Julia nice to meet you nice to meet you too thank you

1:00:33 - Julia that's the kindest anyone in this building has ever been to me

1:00:40 - I wouldn't get used to it lavash looks

1:00:47 - Cylon Julia as if he's disapproving of the fact that she is even speaking to

1:00:52 - you but he lets her finish and says let's step inside Ray and let's hear

1:01:00 - about what it is you think you can do for us that would mitigate your circumstances

1:01:06 - [Music] the doorman open both of the doors one on each side

1:01:13 - and you were able to step in out of a cold night air it's like you remember

1:01:19 - it's all thick plush carpet and dark wood paneling beautifully appointed

1:01:25 - it's like every luxury wannabes magazine dream ad

1:01:31 - come to life and yet it's not ostentatious it's not overdone

1:01:38 - it's refined tasteful it clearly says if you can

1:01:46 - find yourself in this spot you deserve to be here

1:01:52 - inside there are two more of the security guards

1:01:58 - similar to the gentleman you met outside they're here to make sure that uh we

1:02:04 - don't have any repeat incidents I see

1:02:10 - don't worry we'll talk in private I don't think you are here to hurt me or

1:02:16 - anybody else no uh my intention is just to uh just to

1:02:22 - talk I think it's your decision how well that goes well

1:02:29 - come on in he turns and leads you through a door one of the many that

1:02:35 - exit this lobby area and you notice that the other people that you would expect

1:02:42 - to be here or the other Kindred aren't there is no reception

1:02:49 - they've cleared this room just in case [Music]

1:02:56 - the other doors give no indication of what might be behind them and you think you could remember your way perhaps to

1:03:02 - some of the Interior locations if you had to but who knows what's changed since you've been here one thing that

1:03:08 - hasn't changed however is this waiting room you've been here before

1:03:13 - it says well appointed and luxurious as the outer Lobby

1:03:19 - but it's empty except for several chairs

1:03:26 - and a small table have a seat

1:03:32 - button button my jacket as I see sit down

1:03:37 - that is a nice coat

1:03:43 - think so I think it's a little too flashy it's what the Bronx is doing to me

1:03:48 - Bronx I've been there recently oh yeah yeah talking to your Baron twerk

1:03:56 - a baron who's been a baron longer than uh

1:04:04 - the longer than the lifespan of a fly yeah pretty much

1:04:09 - yeah you know you're all bosses so dead and all hmm

1:04:15 - [Music] getting the sense that not a lot of people liked him

1:04:20 - lavashnad's in agreement I don't think anyone could say honestly that they liked

1:04:28 - talk much better at least well spoken

1:04:34 - hmm I've been uh getting acquainted with the

1:04:40 - Bronx over the last year or so or at very least this new version of the

1:04:46 - Bronx that I'm now uh aware of well everyone has to sleep

1:04:52 - somewhere Ray it's good that you found a place where you belong

1:04:58 - I had a place once that's true not too far from here actually

1:05:06 - sure it would take some work to black out the windows properly

1:05:12 - floor-to-ceiling Windows do uh take a bit of paint many of us

1:05:18 - on the right side political fence have seemed to manage

1:05:25 - hmm how'd you get to that right side

1:05:30 - did you claw and work your way to that right side did you

1:05:37 - learn the political ins and outs of

1:05:43 - the entire city and then make your informed decision or were you born into that side

1:05:51 - it's not my fault you were embraced astray

1:05:58 - I didn't do it to you you have no one to blame but the one who made you why do you take it up with them whoever they

1:06:05 - are I have no interest in finding them

1:06:10 - because frankly there's nothing I could do with them that would get my life back

1:06:15 - was that what you want your life back

1:06:21 - well maybe I can swing that for you if I felt like it if I had some incentive but really Ray

1:06:30 - really see yourself in the camera the Ivory Tower I mean

1:06:36 - you look the part you even sound the part but

1:06:41 - your clan as I understand it hit the highway decades ago

1:06:48 - that's been the the little niggle for the last year

1:06:54 - hasn't it as much as I once belonged in Manhattan

1:07:00 - despite ironically despite my bloodline despite my lineage

1:07:07 - despite where I was born despite where I came from

1:07:13 - I'm back to square one [Laughter] someone trying to keep me out of Manhattan because

1:07:20 - of what I was born Julia is nodding as you speak as though

1:07:25 - she understands exactly what you're saying

1:07:33 - and I don't begrudge the system for having rules all I need is

1:07:40 - a few like-minded individuals a few people who

1:07:45 - can see the forest for the trees Hey look

1:07:52 - tall Grant handsome you aren't the only one who gets the crap into the stick I'm not exactly

1:07:59 - Persona grata around here but maybe they're coming around to me right lavash

1:08:06 - shrugs and rolls his eyes as though he couldn't possibly care less look

1:08:12 - I'm what you might call probationary too hmm they don't normally let my clan

1:08:18 - join in the reindeer games

1:08:23 - times are changing new nights right new nights new nights

1:08:30 - so you're Gangrel that's what they tell me yeah

1:08:38 - I don't know of any of your clan that are in the camera in New York but

1:08:44 - on the other hand I'm the only one of my clan here too or that was true until really recently

1:08:52 - um now there's a little Club you might say I'm afraid I'm not familiar I've been

1:08:58 - learning a little of the Clans recently uh you'll have to excuse me the last

1:09:04 - time I saw lavash I was a newborn in this world sucks don't it yeah

1:09:12 - but we adjust I'm making my way and it could be worse

1:09:21 - so if you'll indulge me what is it that your clan claims to be oh allow me

1:09:29 - Julia here is our most prominent member of the clan

1:09:34 - La Sombra which you may have heard of or you may not I don't really know what

1:09:40 - kind of um it education Barren twerk is giving

1:09:46 - your faction these nights as far as I can tell Baron torque is much more interested in

1:09:53 - Baron torque they're not very structured in the Bronx you're not part of this code read then

1:10:00 - his cotery no no haven't had the pleasure yet

1:10:05 - you haven't met your new Baron interesting don't you think the old

1:10:10 - regime goes away in a puff of flame and smoke or Stakes or whatever happened to

1:10:16 - Callahan a new leader proclaims himself practically the same night

1:10:23 - and the cycle begins all over again and if the leader doesn't bother to make acquaintance of well

1:10:31 - the locals like I said it's a lack of

1:10:37 - structure lack of efficiency a lack of

1:10:42 - discipline and frankly sometimes just a lack of manners well

1:10:50 - your manners always were impeccable up to a point so yes Julia is a la Sombra

1:10:58 - they're unusual in the camera just like Gangrel though for very very different reasons

1:11:06 - you might as well tell him look none of this I chose none of this I took you got

1:11:11 - another oh she stubs her cigarette out on the table much to lavasha's disgust

1:11:18 - I didn't choose any of this either I was brought in

1:11:24 - and now I'm here and uh I got some things to do and if I

1:11:30 - do them well I guess I get to stay and if I don't

1:11:35 - well the way I hear it life is short and unsweet

1:11:43 - so I kind of get where you're coming from I do but

1:11:48 - you sure you want I don't know it sounds kind of cool you guys running around out there in the Bronx and sleeping where you want eating

1:11:56 - what you want doing what you want lavash looks really troubled at this

1:12:01 - line of conversation no you trust me you can sleep on any pile of Filth you want

1:12:07 - in the Bronx that is your purview you are given land that you can't uh

1:12:16 - stomach and given the ability to

1:12:22 - run around and do whatever you want as long as it doesn't screw over anyone else doing what they want which

1:12:29 - realistically means you can't do a whole lot

1:12:35 - I don't know doesn't sound that bad to me well yes okay Miss Julia

1:12:41 - um that'll do um Ray listen

1:12:48 - as I said new nights changes the arrival of

1:12:54 - Julia's Clan Has I think persuaded the prince

1:13:01 - to rethink a few of our older policies now I'm not saying there's a guaranteed

1:13:08 - red carpet waiting for you

1:13:15 - but it could be done it could be done

1:13:23 - the ventru clan has Ambitions and goals

1:13:28 - and some of my associates have goals and Ambitions in the Bronx in fact

1:13:34 - yeah I've heard tell of camarilla involvement in the Bronx

1:13:40 - Camry involvement everywhere in the city the Bronx isn't special it's just

1:13:45 - underdeveloped but in order to

1:13:52 - grease those whales to pave your way to introduce you to the right Kindred

1:13:57 - you will have to offer something persuasive

1:14:02 - I can't go empty-headed and say I know a guy we should let him in you know it doesn't work that way

1:14:10 - I've encountered things in the Bronx that uh I

1:14:16 - I never thought I would see admittedly all right life in this world

1:14:22 - is is new to me it took some getting used to when last we spoke I was

1:14:28 - [Music] very unaware and I'm not gonna pretend that I am now

1:14:37 - some ancient and all-knowing kindred but I think there's a few things going

1:14:43 - on in the Bronx that uh the Camarillo be interested in

1:14:50 - and I think that uh a fresh perspective might at least be of some value

1:14:56 - [Music] can't play Both Sides right you know that too right

1:15:02 - if And I stress if this goes the way you want

1:15:07 - There's No Going Back not anymore they won't allow it

1:15:18 - I had a conversation with someone at uh

1:15:23 - a club in the Bronx Club owned by Richter oh I know the name hmm Richter

1:15:30 - is uh exactly the sort we don't want in our club

1:15:35 - hmm yeah but he's successful I'll give him that and

1:15:42 - sometimes profitable sometimes despite his best efforts hmm

1:15:50 - but I had a conversation about

1:15:55 - who pulls your strings who rules your life who

1:16:02 - makes the decisions for you and who's really in control thought you were your own wolf

1:16:16 - prefer to think of it as a a big fish in a small pond looking to

1:16:22 - get back to the ocean if I were to

1:16:28 - go to my associates if I were to go to talk to

1:16:33 - Kadir War Rafferty or even the prince

1:16:40 - what would I say tell them that I have

1:16:47 - information on what you might call a Sabbat project gone wrong

1:16:54 - they both react to the word Sabbat but they react differently

1:17:00 - lavasha's face becomes potentive very very serious he is no longer

1:17:06 - treating this as witty repartee or perhaps situation

1:17:13 - Julia leans forward

1:17:18 - seen one I thought one

1:17:25 - okay you can prove that huh [Music] there's a few people you could talk to I

1:17:31 - would say that I have the marks to prove it but actually the marks are from a car and that kind of proves my point that

1:17:38 - the anarchs don't know what they're doing with this hey

1:17:45 - I heard there's like a famous uh Rebel leader hanging around the Bronx

1:17:52 - somebody come out from the free states Los Angeles Annabelle seen her

1:17:59 - I'd like to meet her oh would you that's what I heard I heard she was around hmm

1:18:07 - might have seen her around listen I gotta admit it is a bit Lively

1:18:12 - in the Bronx listen Ray neither you nor I were here when

1:18:18 - the Ivory Tower defeated its enemy that was all before them

1:18:23 - current unpleasantness it was before the the new Inquisition so I don't have any first-hand knowledge of

1:18:30 - that group but I'm assuming there are people in the camarilla that wouldn't ever want to

1:18:36 - have to deal with the Sabbat again what's done is done what's gone is gone they don't want

1:18:42 - to think about it there are a few that would have to like khadir as you mentioned it's his job

1:18:51 - but uh for the most part dealing with that kind of thing is

1:18:56 - something in the past right for the average camaria kindred

1:19:06 - sure so you might need someone to deal with it in the past

1:19:18 - you fought it how do you know it was

1:19:23 - how do you know what it was did someone say oh that's a Sabbat vampire

1:19:30 - did you have a field manual was there a website I mean how do you know through a conversation with a Hakata

1:19:38 - oh you have been keeping interesting company lately it's not the [ __ ] puttanescas is it it's the [ __ ]

1:19:44 - puttanascus tangentially the [ __ ] puttanescas

1:19:53 - tangentially I'm not quite sure how all the uh

1:19:58 - families and politics work out yet like I said I've been there for a year yeah

1:20:03 - no one really understands how the Hakata work and frankly most of us don't care to a lack of structure like I said

1:20:11 - but I'm picking up on some things

1:20:18 - look right I know you don't know anything about my clan

1:20:25 - but it may interest you to know that at least according to my sire and everybody else who wants to spit on me around here

1:20:32 - that the lassumbra were like we were big in the Sabbat back in the night

1:20:41 - I see why it's harder for the establishment to accept you then yeah there's a there's a whole

1:20:47 - deal I don't even above my pay grade um yeah us in a clan called the

1:21:00 - I don't know uh them and us we kind of is that here tell

1:21:05 - it we kind of started the whole thing started this about yeah I don't I never met one either

1:21:12 - lavashta looks like he doesn't know what the heck Julius is talking about yeah so

1:21:19 - ever since I turned up and

1:21:24 - the others like me turned up there have been a lot of Whispers about

1:21:31 - you know the Sabbat some people think maybe I'm one of them

1:21:37 - spy like I know what I'm doing

1:21:43 - so I'm sympathetic I am

1:21:50 - it ain't worth much but I'll give you a hand appreciate it

1:21:59 - lavash at very least I think this is the least you could do for

1:22:06 - what I'd now like to consider one of my oldest Kindred friends let's not get

1:22:11 - carried away here I was happy very least just

1:22:18 - not raising Stakes when I walk into the city I was happy that with the way things

1:22:24 - were but you know not my call so who are you hanging out

1:22:31 - with these nights if you got yourself a gang is that what they call it in the anarchs cotery yeah we caught that too

1:22:38 - funny similarities and the differences that

1:22:44 - really make us what we are yeah and the hatred that runs in between

1:22:50 - I don't so much as hate anarchs or you're a clan as much as I just do not

1:22:56 - care see that seems like a an easier approach

1:23:02 - to take so who are you hanging out with well

1:23:08 - making some friends another ventrue a what

1:23:15 - um yeah yeah there's there's ventru in the uh anarchs I mean

1:23:20 - we hear that from time to time everybody knows about the you know the baron of Los Angeles the big shot even out here

1:23:29 - we've heard about him but hmm didn't know any of our clan was

1:23:35 - hanging out in your bro that's so disappointing

1:23:42 - well maybe I'll bring her by and uh you can set everything straight maybe

1:23:47 - she'd like to um come over to the right side too

1:23:54 - we'll see how many are interested in yeah

1:23:59 - okay I'm going to mention

1:24:05 - I'm gonna whisper in a few ears that you think you have actual

1:24:14 - contact with something or someone that may or may not

1:24:19 - [Music] be a savant vampire that's going to raise a lot of interest

1:24:26 - you're going to have to prove it you're going to have to back it up if they decide that that's your ticket but

1:24:34 - I'm going to ask you for a favor it's not really a favor actually you

1:24:40 - just need to do this for me if you want me to help you this ventro you hang out with

1:24:46 - want to know her name in fact I want to know everything about

1:24:51 - her that you can tell me we don't have to get into that this very

1:24:59 - moment but I'm going to give you a way to contact me

1:25:05 - and I expect you to do this in return for which

1:25:10 - [Music] I will do what I can

1:25:16 - to get your membership reinstated

1:25:22 - I'll keep him honest I'll keep him honest don't worry we got this we got this this is going to be really interesting

1:25:28 - I never hung out with the well I mean there was Tamika but I think she left the city I never hung out with a gang

1:25:34 - girl before well

1:25:39 - hopefully we don't have to introduce you to the uh

1:25:45 - what the clan is all about take this

1:25:51 - he hands you a very expensively made business card matte black

1:25:57 - with what looks like genuine gold inlay around the edges

1:26:04 - it's got a phone number on it and nothing else if you get into serious trouble

1:26:15 - there's something that you could say that might get you out of it don't ask me what it means because I

1:26:22 - cannot tell you this is pure favor

1:26:27 - Atticus bones [Music]

1:26:34 - now get out of here before someone sees us not a problem we'll stand up

1:26:41 - button my jacket and make my way to the door and as I get

1:26:46 - to the door I'll turn look back at Julia say oh by the way

1:26:54 - it's pronounced zamizi

1:27:01 - Julia nods

1:27:06 - I liked my way better this seems like a very good place

1:27:14 - to pause this vampire story for now

1:27:35 - hey everyone I'm yev uh here from New York City now Victor sent me out here to

1:27:40 - do some tech work for a friend of his I haven't quite met up with them yet but but either way very exciting to be sent

1:27:45 - on the location now back to the Blazing uh Big Apple as they call it lots of fun things about the uh the Big Apple uh

1:27:52 - it's got It's got apples they're huge uh the nice thing about it is I tend to

1:27:57 - retain my memory out here back on the west coast I would lose entire days

1:28:02 - which was super strange and very weird but Victor never seemed to be bothered

1:28:08 - by that in my my memory lapses so that was good it didn't affect my employment which is great I love everything about

1:28:14 - it uh I guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the Big Apple uh I'm

1:28:19 - I'm helping some of his friends or at least I'm supposed to be hopefully soon when they reach out but um I wanted to

1:28:26 - to tell you the same thing that I'm going to tell them which is uh if you go to backblaze.com

1:36:12 - [Music]

1:36:28 - is very early in the morning

1:36:33 - just a couple hours remaining until sunrise until that line of

1:36:39 - Coral pink yellow and white stains The Horizon and

1:36:46 - the Kindred must sleep to be caught

1:36:52 - under the Rays of the Sun is death for the vampires

1:37:00 - we might wonder if they miss it we might wonder what they would do

1:37:07 - to feel it on their faces once more as we wonder we find ourselves in mott

1:37:13 - Haven just north of the Bruckner Expressway not far from where our cotery fought the

1:37:22 - murderous creature the monster that's been terrorizing the area in recent nights now mod Haven is heard it all before

1:37:29 - dangerous Baron a place to pass through on route

1:37:35 - to somewhere else but the neighborhood is no longer defined by those old stereotypes it's

1:37:42 - undergoing gradual changes like many places in this Borough

1:37:47 - restaurants opening older buildings becoming renovated around St Mary's Park

1:37:54 - and the church nearby new apartments being built on those many

1:38:00 - gap-toothed vacant Lots sandwiched between the monolithic City housing

1:38:05 - projects we are in one of those many vacant Lots

1:38:10 - now with serif and Francis a couple of subway stops away from

1:38:16 - Richter's Club the cage and here we have dead grass and cold dry hard packed

1:38:24 - Earth discarded tires chunks of broken concrete with lengths of rusted rebar

1:38:31 - sticking through in all directions like metallic fingers lots of plastic bags

1:38:37 - skidding along the ground on the cool early morning Breeze

1:38:43 - you and Francis have come here to find

1:38:48 - something that you've been saving for a special occasion

1:38:54 - a huge pristine unblemished untagged

1:39:02 - piece of concrete lying flat on the ground

1:39:08 - in this vacant lot how no one has found this treasure you have no idea

1:39:15 - but you've kept it secret until now so yeah as I was saying

1:39:22 - it hasn't been the best week yeah are those

1:39:29 - kindred really your friends

1:39:35 - I think I've gotten a new definition for the word friends of recent what's your

1:39:40 - beef with Kindred you say every Kinder doesn't like you but I don't think that that's accurate

1:39:47 - well you heard what I am then blood yeah yeah

1:39:53 - and you're uh aravnos I don't even know what that is I don't

1:39:58 - either sounds cool ravnos brand

1:40:05 - maybe it's just because you got that weird upbeat Personality yeah sometimes right not tonight though

1:40:12 - um I don't think much of ours Simone

1:40:18 - that's how most Kindred treat me kick you to the curb no matter what city

1:40:24 - I'm in that's how we get treated even in LA

1:40:31 - and that's supposed to be a free state right you would not believe what happened to

1:40:38 - me back there what happened just it's a long story can you tell me the

1:40:44 - short version yeah we came here to paint right we did you got your uh weapons

1:40:53 - all right so um as he talks Francis rummages around in your um

1:40:59 - canvas bag of spray paint and pulls out a few canisters magenta okay whatever all right pick a

1:41:08 - color you like I like this turquoise one great okay can we use it let's fall on that impulse how

1:41:13 - do you it's sealed how do we get I got an idea

1:41:18 - okay yeah I mean

1:41:25 - do you ever hear any of your codery friends whatever did they ever

1:41:32 - talk about gehenna you ever hear of it no gehenna sounds stupid doesn't it I

1:41:38 - mean you sound stupid to you well it might be real okay it's this

1:41:45 - Vampire Apocalypse oh and there are

1:41:50 - sacred texts that claim we thin Bloods are somehow the cause of this

1:41:56 - catastrophe so Kindred who believe in that

1:42:02 - fairy tale hate us and Hunt us because of it

1:42:08 - camarilla especially elders the older they are the more they believe

1:42:16 - it hmm well I'm pretty young

1:42:21 - in L.A I had to leave because some kindred

1:42:27 - told us that we weren't welcome there anarchs

1:42:34 - a baron hmm yeah so you left

1:42:41 - seemed like the smart move it's time I've knocked around different cities before I came here and

1:42:49 - found the band hmm they keep you safe though don't they I

1:42:54 - mean this clan even really matter so much to the anarchs doesn't to Darby

1:43:01 - doesn't Frida I mean what matters is what we are what we can be

1:43:08 - right yeah and that has to be so much more important than whatever ridiculous

1:43:14 - lineage is in our blood I think

1:43:20 - so I'm not sure exactly how we should do this but are you ready for an experiment

1:43:26 - yeah okay we need uh oh yeah here we go he reaches down to the cold stiff ground

1:43:35 - pulls upper empty soda can at least he hopes it's empty checks inside yeah okay this will

1:43:42 - work I'm going to put some of my blood in here and uh

1:43:48 - can you can you put paint in the can

1:43:54 - I'll do my best

1:43:59 - he pulls out an old-fashioned safety razor blade from

1:44:05 - somewhere in his pants you're not sure how he carried that without cutting himself

1:44:10 - holds his wrist over the can places the can on the concrete slab

1:44:19 - slices the blade across his skin and begins to

1:44:25 - fill the soda can with it what is your current hunger sir one

1:44:33 - you can feel the Beast and you react to the sight and the smell of the Vitae but

1:44:39 - you're not hungry enough to have to worry about losing control not yet

1:44:46 - yeah I don't know I mean if Clan doesn't matter if we can you

1:44:52 - know transcend this experience become more than what we are

1:44:59 - I want to do it but I think we have to leave our human selves behind and that's where we all

1:45:05 - get hung up okay that should be enough

1:45:11 - hmm well it'll heal

1:45:16 - now it won't even I have to do that trick concentrates

1:45:25 - and the dead flesh mends together okay

1:45:32 - okay can you get some paint in there yeah I'll do my best um so I take a gold spray paint and I uh

1:45:41 - spray it into the can as delicately and as you know precisely

1:45:46 - as I can

1:45:52 - some of the metallic guilt color the liquid gold as it were

1:45:59 - cools on the top of the can and Spills down the sides gets on your on your skin

1:46:04 - but you get a fair quantity in there okay Shake It Up

1:46:11 - look at this all right cool now we need uh I don't know what we need

1:46:17 - um every formula is different and every one of us who can do this and

1:46:25 - not all of us can does it differently I know one thin

1:46:30 - blood who can make the same stuff that helps me get off the ground

1:46:36 - but the ingredients are totally different it's like you know Anthony Bourdain on one side and emerald on the

1:46:42 - other I mean it just doesn't interesting comparison to cooking well I

1:46:48 - mean it is cooking I'm going to show you we don't have a we don't have a proper you know athenor

1:46:55 - or a you got to cook this stuff oh um and we all do it differently some of

1:47:02 - us use like well you know you can cook it like in a chemistry lab like a Bunsen burner or

1:47:09 - some of us use like a crock pot or a pressure cooker I mean all kinds of different things

1:47:14 - some of us know how to do it inside ourselves

1:47:20 - and that's what I'm going to do as soon as we let's see Sarah

1:47:27 - what do you have in your head a picture of what you're going to paint you know already or is it just come to

1:47:34 - you does it come from some hidden secret place inside you that you go to when you

1:47:41 - want to how does it work for you sometimes I plant them in advance this time I was gonna try and see what

1:47:49 - what took me over hmm

1:47:57 - okay then in that case put some of your blood in the can okay

1:48:05 - um probably shouldn't use the same razor blade huh I mean it's not like well I

1:48:10 - mean I don't know you do your way I'm gonna I'm gonna Fang it

1:48:15 - I'm gonna puncture your wrist with a Fang yeah slice the uh skin open and add

1:48:21 - your vitae stairs at the Crimson liquid

1:48:28 - is it pours and drips into the can wow I just I mean

1:48:35 - it's always a rush right yeah I guess

1:48:41 - do you heal the wound by a traditional method of licking it yeah

1:48:49 - okay paint paint something else something else do

1:48:54 - you have like [Music] um oh yeah okay there we go cool

1:49:02 - he uh steps to the other side of the slab and he picks up

1:49:09 - a few rusted nails that are laying on the ground let's try this I don't have

1:49:14 - time to uh you're extremely underprepared for this experiment you know I didn't plan to go on a spray date

1:49:21 - okay so bear with me you should expect the unexpected

1:49:27 - well I'm a little busy but okay I'll keep it in mind it's just good life advice

1:49:33 - good life advice we aren't alive serif or at least we're not

1:49:39 - that's all gone all our old ideas of humanity he adds the nails to the cannon you can

1:49:45 - hear them rattling around and here as he shakes it up I mean that's all is that even relevant anymore doesn't it feel

1:49:52 - more like a prison or a burden to you you're asking me questions that I have no capacity to answer

1:49:58 - well maybe you should think about them if you could remove that burden from you would you feel so strongly about some

1:50:03 - stuff would you be so upset when your friends treat you like crap really [ __ ] sick of getting lectured about

1:50:08 - what I think I'm just out just actions just asking questions I don't know what

1:50:13 - I think about them I don't know what I think about myself okay that's fair that's fair we I need a couple more

1:50:20 - things why don't you ask me some questions I love a god let's see how about you got hunted in

1:50:27 - L.A and and you're kicked out of L.A oh you got kicked out of La they didn't want us there

1:50:33 - I thought they were better than we are how did you find the other thin Bloods

1:50:39 - well I went to Detroit and

1:50:45 - um nothing good happens in Detroit yeah you're not wrong about that but something good did happen to me

1:50:51 - there I met other thin Bloods and you know like me they asked questions

1:50:57 - and they got me to realize that

1:51:02 - I just had to change my perspective I had to stop thinking about myself like

1:51:08 - a person anymore because I'm not I know nobody wants to talk about it because it brings us down

1:51:13 - but we're not people anymore and the sooner we get used to that idea

1:51:18 - I think the better off we are the stronger we get and I think the more

1:51:24 - frankly I think the more potential we have I mean don't you feel a little limited by all this crap give me some of your um

1:51:30 - give me some of your cool eyeshadow this shit's expensive well I mean

1:51:37 - all right put it in here okay good all right [Music] um

1:51:45 - let's see what would be good I wish we had some math math cocaine or

1:51:52 - something any you got any drugs anything it doesn't really matter what I

1:51:58 - um aspirin no why would you okay nothing like that I think we could get a

1:52:04 - yeah maybe gave me some weed perfect okay yeah all right I open up a

1:52:11 - tiny little pocket inside of another larger pocket of the canvas bag and pull out like a couple rolled joints awesome

1:52:17 - yeah put one of them they're not good and I assume it doesn't matter awesome okay

1:52:29 - he shakes it up swirls it all together takes a sniff

1:52:36 - God I don't have a pressure cooker or anything so I don't really know what's gonna happen okay

1:52:44 - Bottoms Up oh drinks the mixture from the can

1:52:52 - oh that is God awful yeah there's tetanus and weed in there

1:52:57 - yeah this is gonna be interesting right we gotta wait a bit okay I'm gonna have a

1:53:03 - seat just a few minutes and then we can get we can get going okay

1:53:08 - wow oh that's so bad I mean bad for you usually I put some

1:53:15 - flavoring in this stuff you know but you have to drink it like I said there are different ways but

1:53:21 - if we don't have a way to cook it out here so I'm gonna I guess you could say I'm gonna cook it

1:53:27 - in me interesting takes a couple of minutes um and then we're gonna paint

1:53:34 - see what happens because you're still warm what do you mean like your insides are

1:53:40 - still warm I don't mean cook it literally oh at least I don't have to like jump up

1:53:46 - and down and shake it like that so you're funny I get that a lot

1:53:53 - well it's accurate you're funny too that's what I hear

1:54:00 - I don't uh I don't know if I like your friends or whatever they are

1:54:06 - especially the uh Wolf Man or whatever he is or something

1:54:11 - what was up with that I don't know but he wasn't happy about it see now

1:54:18 - there's a kindred that is in touch with his true self is

1:54:25 - Beast or whatever you want to call it the monster within whatever you mean you feel it right yeah everybody does of

1:54:31 - course everybody feels it differently but man what's his name Ray Raymond Ray Ray

1:54:40 - you know he's into it he's on a first name basis with it you thought he liked

1:54:45 - it what happened did you no I was impressed

1:54:51 - I mean there is a vampire that's leaving the

1:54:56 - mortal coil behind fast you know he's I I don't know do you didn't think he liked it I mean have you

2:00:43 - vitae smear

2:00:48 - and circulate and come together Palm to Palm

2:00:54 - it's a strange tingling sensation it doesn't hurt

2:00:59 - it's like the memory when you were alive

2:01:04 - and one of your limbs would fall asleep and go numb something that you haven't felt

2:01:12 - since Argus took you into this on life

2:01:18 - think about what you want to make and let it rip let it do it I paint a huge

2:01:24 - sweeping Sun I would like you to please

2:01:29 - make a dice pool formed of all your unspent willpower all the blank will power boxes how many

2:01:36 - is that at this time

2:01:43 - and I add hunger to that nope it's just willpower so it's only

2:01:49 - black dice how many dices in the pool five tell me what you get

2:01:58 - no successes no successes at all

2:02:07 - you take a point of superficial willpower damage as doubt

2:02:13 - and fear compete for control of your rational

2:02:19 - self but you don't lose control but you do hear his voice

2:02:29 - what do you think you are doing I don't know

2:02:35 - neither do I but it's very very exciting I'm not sure if I want to make you happy

2:02:45 - you say that now

2:02:50 - you feel your arm and your hand with a spray can moving

2:02:57 - slowly at first as you paint and then faster and faster

2:03:03 - Strokes of the air driven pigment moving smoothly effortlessly

2:03:11 - along the concrete slab feels

2:03:17 - very different from anything that you've done before it would be difficult to say if it felt bad or good but

2:03:25 - the design you are making is

2:03:31 - perb now a new pool please

2:03:39 - let's make it wits and crafts

2:03:46 - you can add your extra die for your specialty and tagging um

2:03:51 - sorry I think it's a pool of sex yes

2:04:02 - six six successes that is rather a lot of success

2:04:11 - 's hand s around yours and there's a some sort

2:04:16 - of jolt free zone of electricity that seems to Arc between your blood and his

2:04:25 - your hand seems to fly over the concrete of its own accord you're not even sure that you

2:04:33 - are in control of what you are creating now francis's eyes close

2:04:39 - you can see that he's enjoying the moment feeling it at a fundamental level

2:04:47 - and it's over perhaps all too soon

2:04:54 - looking at what you've made together on the slab

2:05:01 - you are filled with uncertain emotions it's

2:05:10 - it's weird and not like anything you have made before and if someone asks you to

2:05:18 - describe it to them the words might not come so easily

2:05:24 - oh

2:05:29 - look at you look what you did

2:05:36 - you hear it in your head him

2:05:41 - her they whatever see when you listen to it

2:05:49 - it's better

2:05:54 - he hasn't healed his hand yet he looks at the slab

2:06:00 - may I yeah thank you with his still bleeding

2:06:05 - Palm starts to press it into the slab

2:06:12 - where every Ray of the Sun reaches its Terminus so each Sun Ray ends in a bloody palm print

2:06:23 - what do you think that's it's incredible

2:06:30 - good yeah I think it's beyond good

2:06:38 - it won't last forever the rain the wind snow event

2:30:52 - I did it most of all I don't know what you did and I don't

2:30:57 - think I need to know but

2:31:03 - it sounds like you know it was wrong even if you don't totally feel it

2:31:09 - you know whatever it was was wrong

2:31:15 - you remember when uh

2:31:21 - me and Tabitha cousin Tabitha were staying at your place and uh

2:31:26 - we stole all those candy bars and your mom marched us back to the store made us give him back yeah we knew

2:31:33 - it was wrong yeah but we did it anyway now I'm not saying you stole candy bars

2:31:38 - but the point was there was somebody there to make us do

2:31:44 - the right thing that's not really comparable to whatever it is that's happened but

2:31:53 - if you know it was wrong can't you I don't know

2:32:02 - can you make up for it can you make good

2:32:09 - is it I think I can try well if it ain't too late to do the right thing then do the right thing

2:32:23 - I'm gonna go and I don't know when I'm gonna run into you again

2:32:30 - well I mean it's not like you don't know how to find me yeah yeah so if I wake up one morning and you're like

2:32:38 - sleeping on the sofa bed and I just don't wake you yeah wow I'm a heavy

2:32:45 - sleeper now so yeah real heavy

2:32:53 - I would do protect you okay I believe you

2:33:00 - you would do anything to protect all of us yeah your mom says Zell Tabby I mean

2:33:07 - come on you are Fuego

2:33:14 - you know right from wrong we all do and yet we all do the wrong

2:33:19 - thing sometimes

2:33:27 - so you're right when the hell did you get so wise

2:33:32 - you know I'm a student at Fordham University oh my God thanks to somebody special

2:33:40 - hey if I hug you yeah let's go come on let's make with the hug action

2:33:46 - he's warm against you you can feel his heartbeat

2:33:53 - against your body I think she just gets lost in that for a little while

2:34:00 - it's hard not to remember

2:34:05 - like this his childhood yours family life

2:34:11 - the uh dreams that you pursued when you were his age

2:34:17 - and in school all right now you're going to make me

2:34:23 - cry but you know it's just gonna be cry cry it ain't gonna be like you know Crimson cry or whatever it is you guys

2:34:28 - are doing that's a pretty cool good name for band right Crimson cry

2:34:34 - so I won't see you for a while what are you gonna do

2:34:40 - take care of the monster problem

2:34:46 - and then I'm gonna figure out a way to take care of our neighborhood

2:34:52 - that's the nice thing about having a City full of cousins with different last names and everyone's

2:34:59 - family you gotta look out for all of them right yeah you do

2:35:05 - I'll help but I just don't know what I can do

2:35:11 - keep it feels so hard because so much of my

2:35:18 - life is about the lie that we use

2:35:23 - to keep people safe keep seeking truth but

2:35:29 - be careful okay I think I understand

2:35:35 - I guess there's scarier things out there than me

2:35:42 - okay take care of yourself

2:35:50 - go inside it's cold as hell [ __ ] it gives you a final squeeze around the

2:35:57 - shoulders tightens up his Yankees jacket

2:36:03 - Justice his hat and uh

2:36:10 - leaves you alone on the steps so

2:36:15 - at this point we have some housekeeping to take care of

2:36:25 - you know that what you did was over the line that it was

2:36:32 - brutal and cold and completely unnecessary

2:36:40 - perhaps it didn't conflict

2:36:45 - with any specific moral conviction that you're following in this

2:36:53 - whatever this is but

2:36:58 - you said it yourself you crossed the line and there are some lines that aren't

2:37:04 - to be crossed so

2:37:10 - the part of you that's still human knows this

2:37:16 - I'm going to give you two stains on your humanity and that means

2:37:25 - you have only one unmarked box on your Humanity track yeah now

2:37:31 - ordinarily we would roll one die

2:37:38 - and you have a 50 50 chance of 6

2:37:44 - 6 but because you are trying to remember

2:37:51 - how it feels to be the kind of person you were and

2:37:57 - want to be I'm going to add a second die

2:38:04 - to the roll to the pool so take two black dice

2:38:12 - now if the role is a success if either die

2:38:18 - is a hunk then

2:38:24 - you'll hold your Humanity Where You Are if they are both failures

2:38:30 - then you will start down that spiral that everybody

2:38:35 - keeps warning you about when you're ready please make your

2:38:40 - Humanity role

2:38:47 - Lego's face sitting on the steps and I think she pulls out from under her

2:38:52 - shirt the note that just said r on it

2:38:59 - and she clutches it and she feels that dissonance between

2:39:07 - what her brain knows about him and what she feels

2:39:16 - her blood sings to him and that she was so relieved and

2:39:23 - overjoyed and this Feels So Close to Love it feels

2:39:28 - but she knows it's wrong that this isn't normal this isn't like

2:39:33 - anything that anyone in her codery described

2:39:39 - but she can't let it go

2:39:49 - two successes two successes

2:39:55 - whatever your humanity is now that you were a kindred a vampire

2:40:02 - suffers enough guilt or shame or regret

2:40:07 - or remorse

2:40:12 - throw a barrier against slipping further down into the pit of

2:40:20 - the Beast that you know is waiting there for you your Humanity remain s where it is

2:40:28 - and you may erase all the stains and you have a chance to try again

2:40:36 - which really is all any of us could ever ask for

2:40:41 - which makes this seem like the appropriate place

2:40:47 - to end this particular vampire story for now
