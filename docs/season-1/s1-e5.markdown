# Season 1 Episode 5 - Darkness Clings

### WIP- current captions directly ripped from youtube.

0:00 - hello good evening and Welcome to our vampire the Masquerade Chronicle New York by

0:08 - night we continue our story about a codery of fledgling anarch vampires in the Bronx

0:17 - with season one episode five Darkness clings

0:24 - let's meet our vampires who are clinging to the darkness

0:30 - I'm Alex Ward I play Isaac Brook as amitsi I'm mianna Baron I play serif the

0:36 - mischievous ravnos I'm a Bria Angar playing Fuego the

0:43 - we're gonna go with spicy again been true and I'm Joey rasul I'm playing Rey the

0:48 - corporate gang girl I'm Jason Carl your Storyteller and a special guest will be joining us at a

0:54 - dramatically appropriate moment now let me dramatically thank some

1:00 - special friends black magic design for the cameras that bring us to you in

1:08 - these beautiful unliving colors Renegade game studios who make sure that

1:13 - we have our hunger dice ready at a moment's notice and dogmite games for our beautiful

1:19 - Storyteller screen and the dice trays and dice boxes

1:26 - that our vampires are using

1:33 - as a prologue let's return to that blood-soaked layer cake we keep

1:40 - talking about cake represents the unlife of the

1:45 - Kindred and we focused on the bottom tier and on the middle tier because that

1:51 - is where many vampire stories happen but we would be remiss if we did not

1:57 - mention the very top level of the cake the highest tier

2:04 - Kindred up here get a view like no other

2:10 - they can see out over the whole puzzle they can see the whole board

2:15 - and all its pieces and they can get a glimpse of how the whole thing

2:22 - fits together now these are the rarified tastes at

2:27 - this level of the cake the hidden flavors these kindreds stand on the backs of everybody else

2:34 - and they're often unseen they watch the Watchers they pull the

2:39 - puppet strings from up here and their heads are above the black clouds of the

2:46 - city and the only thing they really have to worry about is The Heat Of The Sun melting away

2:51 - everything right that is until the kindred

2:57 - on the other layers of the cake figure out what's really going on and who's up

3:02 - there and what they're doing then all bets are off

3:11 - with this firmly in mind let's tell a vampire story

3:20 - [Music]

3:27 - [Music]

3:56 - thank you

4:06 - [Music]

4:19 - [Music]

4:24 - foreign

4:32 - [Music]

4:43 - let us make no mistake Kindred our singular monsters

4:49 - they have powers and problems that no other inhabitant of the world of

4:55 - Darkness has an eternal struggle over a long-desired Haven that plays out over a decade

5:03 - a refinement of the Vitae burned in The Crucible of Undead flesh manifesting

5:09 - itself in refinement of Supernatural powers or dredging up of long forgotten memories

5:17 - a fight in the back alley where the only thing doing more damage than the slashing blades and tearing fangs are

5:23 - the endless insults the razor sharp wit all these are part of their own lives

5:32 - they dwell in a nocturnal world where a social slight can literally invoke a

5:38 - frenzy where a chess game over resources

5:44 - can play out over the course of a Thousand Nights

5:49 - we're moving a single piece on that chessboard at the right time in the right direction

5:56 - can change all the stakes and the hair is breadth of a moment

6:02 - the challenge of course is that many Kindred do not see most of these moves

6:07 - if they even perceive the board at all until it is almost

6:15 - too late

6:22 - our codery has had some very interesting nights recently

6:27 - they have fought a monster a creature a

6:32 - ravening thing on the streets the South Bronx they have met cat

6:39 - Costello Clan Hakata and they've received an opportunity from

6:46 - cat too make the whole puttanesca problem go away and they've learned some things about

6:52 - themselves and some surprising things about one another as well

6:58 - so let's return to our codery the night after you're meeting with cat Costello and her

7:05 - friend Frankie the skull let's begin with your hunger

7:12 - so everyone should break a rouse check check for Hunger to see if you woke up

7:17 - tonight hungrier than you were when the Sun came up uh Isaac I'm at two you're at

7:26 - two hunger I'm at three you got hungry when you woke up tonight yep oh

8:03 - and Rey hungry or three hungry or three

8:12 - care again my next question then is before you gather

8:18 - to take care of the night's business do you hunt first or do you show up

8:26 - As You Are start at the opposite end of the table this time and I'll ask Ray the question

8:35 - this would be an excellent opportunity to

8:41 - start talking a little bit about some pack tactics and

8:48 - working together as a codery and understanding

8:54 - what everyone's good at and what everybody uh brings to the table

9:00 - do I take it to understand then do I understand correctly then that you do not hunt for blood before you meet with

9:06 - them that you arrive at Hunger three no I'm talking about potentially going

9:13 - and hunting as a pack let's hold that thought

9:18 - what about Margo oh you know what I'm fine

9:26 - it's fine I'll have to hide we're great this is great I'm gonna roll with it yeah yeah we're good

9:37 - anything to keep your voice in my ear just a little more just remember you said that

9:44 - what about serif right I could eat [Music]

9:55 - before they got there absolutely they got that please make a uh let's uh

10:00 - let's go with your Predator type and make it um either strength and intimidation or

10:06 - manipulation and intimidation whichever you choose would I get a specialty for my all right

10:14 - guys if you're using it yes you do yes you do so you'd add an extra die for that

10:23 - I know we're all we're all waiting this happens uh two successes two successes

10:30 - more than enough more than enough to uh extort

10:35 - the blood you need how many Hunger dice do you remove just

10:40 - one just one so that'll put you at one one okay serif and Ray

10:48 - gonna hunt together [Music] yeah do you have similar Predator types

11:18 - Hunt fresh I'm a scene Queen you like to feed among those who know

11:25 - your Fame yeah I've got those friends and Margo prefers a more intimate way to

11:32 - slake the hunger you do have friends you have friends that you can call on who

11:37 - will willingly give you what you need yeah no hunt necessary

14:26 - okay I'm not telling you to not be a nice person but just I'm not a nice

14:32 - person just keep in mind what you're worth laughs

14:40 - I don't think you're the person who should be telling me about self-worth

14:47 - you know what I'll take the criticism on that don't

14:52 - keep it in mind a lot of Kindred Society does run on the acquiring and dishing out of favors

14:58 - though so keep that in mind don't give anything for free if you

15:04 - don't have to why do we got to keep stuff why can't we just because

15:10 - you will be at a supreme disadvantage if you are the only one not keeping things because everyone else is

15:16 - maybe I don't like keeping things enjoy the rest of your own life I plan

15:22 - to so three

15:27 - willing vessels three vampires spam Quirk and blue

15:35 - are into it because it's you who's asking they'll share

15:41 - I'm glad the question is of course how much hunger do you satisfy

15:47 - how much do you take two take two away so it takes two hunger are

15:54 - they just a quick you know dietary check they're from the Bronx

15:59 - two of them are Gibbs on spam

16:07 - it's all yours thank you two for you as well three vampires feeding in the

16:12 - shadows somehow more satisfying to know that place in

16:19 - which you are feeding belongs to you this is your neighborhood your territory your Turf your domain

16:28 - you are the rulers of the night here and everything in it

16:35 - belongs to you somehow it's just more satisfying that way

16:41 - when it's over The Mortals are of course a little a

16:47 - little woozy a little dizzy hey you good always good

16:54 - you always make it good you always make it good too

16:59 - spam is a little reluctant to say goodbye but do you know we got a project

17:06 - yes will you tell me about it well you said you had something you wanted I did

17:14 - I've got my eye on this nice big empty space big brick wall um

17:22 - and under it I want to put we suck but in big fancy Gothic

17:29 - ah can it be dripping with blood drops yes

17:36 - they start to talk together excitedly I like when they get the wheel spinning like that

17:42 - we're on the job we'll make you proud you won't regret it great use the stencils by the way that I cut and I

17:48 - pull out some backpack full of plastic it'll go faster than the police won't catch it

17:54 - they take the stencils

18:00 - and with a quick kiss on the cheek they make their way out to start the

18:06 - project they are so cute how any of you enjoy feeding without like just just feeding

18:14 - not for me not my favorite but it's fine that's fine

18:21 - is it yeah you don't have to do that every time it's fun anyway

18:28 - on to Isaac's then or do you have any stops to make along

18:33 - the way I gotta go check on a trash can

18:40 - I'll catch up there was wishy-washy okay sure so you make a detour

18:48 - to a trash can a certain trash can a certain Park

18:53 - in a certain part of your territory hmm well

19:00 - the park is vacant there are people on the streets nearby

19:06 - but no one in the park proper and it's a small little patch of grass that is

19:12 - struggling to grow with one tree

19:19 - bare limbs at this time of year trash can is next to a park bench the

19:25 - wood of the bench is almost completely obscured by years of carvings into the

19:30 - surface they overlap one another it's almost impossible to tell what any of them mean

19:36 - anymore you have to sift in the garbage can for

19:42 - it not a lot of fun but you do find it eventually near the bottom

19:48 - in an old potato chip bag it's a good disguise

19:53 - who would look inside

19:59 - is a small leather-bound Journal

20:08 - paging through it quickly you can see that the writing is in a language that

20:13 - it is not immediately familiar to you it could be a regular language and you just need you know Google translate or

20:20 - might be something more complicated there are diagrams here and there too pictures and sketches of people and

20:27 - places and there's sticky note on the inside cover

20:35 - and it says see you soon

20:40 - xo xo and the letter A you know his handwriting

20:51 - I take it and I look at the park bench and I I spray paint it gold

21:01 - spray paint the park bench gold yes

21:07 - covering up all those paint flecks and carvings they're still visible under the paint

21:13 - but now they're a uniform gilded hue

21:20 - and then I go and then you go let us move the scene then can I

21:25 - actually talk to Ray on the way back I don't see why you couldn't

21:31 - walk with me or do you have to go see a park about a trash can too

21:37 - yeah I do have some business in the park tomorrow night but no we can

21:45 - um you were mentioning earlier that we should talk about the things that we're good at

21:50 - you know for like the good of the group uh I think maybe I should take point with Richter from now on

21:57 - we have an understanding and you get on his nerves

22:03 - that seems fine yeah yeah you can go off and spend your time there that's

22:09 - no problem okay the [ __ ] is this what is this energy

22:15 - foreign look I just

22:28 - I have a hard time

22:34 - I want to say that I have a hard time trusting you and that's not the case

22:39 - I have a hard time trusting myself around you

22:49 - oh yeah

22:54 - I don't know what that means and I am fascinated by what you do I am

23:03 - goddamn jealous of what you do but

23:11 - I don't know who you're doing it to I don't know if

23:17 - you are genuinely someone that we

23:22 - like and enjoy being around or there's something that's telling us to

23:30 - okay because I've watched people flip in front of you

23:35 - from hating you to loving you no one's ever hated me but I get what

23:40 - you're saying look if I wanted to Wham you I just would

23:48 - and I want to use ah right now requires no Rouse check you simply use

23:56 - it you will yourself to be preacher naturally attractive alluring and convincing

24:06 - let me go ahead and use unswayable mind hmm

24:12 - swayable mind fortitude power

24:24 - so for this scene you are supernaturally Charming and you

24:31 - are supernaturally resistant to charm they both require roles if you want to use them

24:38 - I think it's fun for now okay I see you're stealing yourself

24:44 - against me do you hate me when I get closer

24:53 - look I just

24:58 - answer the question no

25:03 - they don't hate you

25:09 - but I don't answer questions so readily for a lot of people

25:14 - okay noted

25:21 - maybe you just like me

25:26 - I'm very likable yeah maybe

25:32 - maybe that's all it is who could say and I drop off and turn

25:38 - and keep walking

25:46 - let's now move the scene to Isaacs to The Brownstone

25:54 - by the East River that has quickly become the usual Gathering Spot the

26:00 - headquarters as it were possibly the clubhouse of the cotery

26:05 - what's happening there tonight uh

26:11 - hello welcome everybody good to see you good evening hi hi hello I assume you all

26:18 - took care of yourselves before showing up I've yet to uh think of a way to

26:25 - serve Refreshments yet other than uh

26:30 - complicated ways it's fair so last night was something wasn't it um

26:38 - holy [ __ ] look I I mean I kind of understood what happened but

26:46 - did we fight a zombie no are you sure no

26:51 - oh um what the exact words that were said to us were it was a

26:57 - Sabbat experiment gone wrong but that is very vague and doesn't necessarily give

27:04 - us any answers more than we had already and could not necessarily be true the problem is is the spot we're here a

27:12 - long time ago with the war and everything and I'm sure there are a lot of things left under these streets that

27:18 - uh were there because of them so doesn't necessarily mean anything new is

27:23 - happening could just be old things that were disturbed by the making of that building

27:29 - and again I just want to put on the table we could level the buildings maybe I don't know yeah I want to do that one

27:36 - yes it is something we could do but we could also have a lot of negative consequences come our way for doing it

27:43 - sure it feels like you always negate whatever somebody else just said

27:48 - you ask a lot of questions yes is that wrong no it's not it's just

27:55 - weird I'm just saying the consequences for

28:01 - leveling a building even in the Bronx are a lot if we are to be found out

28:07 - and we do have to get underneath said building yeah to find said skull Oh Captain Charlie that's right yes I am do

28:14 - we trust that cat can keep the puttanesque off her back no well

28:20 - she thinks she can that's as much as we can trust yeah she

28:27 - also stopped us from stopping that thing just to tell us that she didn't know what it was yeah and so I don't trust

28:33 - her judgment all that no I'm only trusting what she said when I forced her to say

28:39 - the truth by the way that was great yeah well never seen you like that before

28:47 - you know different things for different people

28:55 - we find this skull she thinks she can keep the puttanescas off her back which is as good as we're gonna get

29:01 - considering we do not have a quarter or half a million to pay off the debt

29:07 - it's true not right now so are there any other Creative Solutions you all can think of other than just

29:14 - just going and looking for this I wonder if we can leverage some more negotiation with if we get it if we can ask for a

29:20 - little bit more than what she's offering that is fair that is something we can probably do

29:25 - I'm sure Ray would come in handy in that aspect how's your scoop by the way

29:31 - uh this is a new one didn't you also get thrown into like the overpass oh right

29:37 - probably do something about that hmm okay every time we go out you get hurt

29:43 - I'm just putting it out there I guess that is true you have taken some superficial damage

29:50 - in the in the fight against the whatever it was is that something that you want to uh

29:57 - deal with well let's see giving your blood potency

30:07 - you can heal I believe it's one with every Rouse check is that right yes it is so you are

30:16 - suffering from three I I've Fed so now I'm at one again I know I know but no but I'm suffering from three damage

30:22 - correct your health yes you have three superficial so

30:27 - you can heal as many as you want and regardless of the results of the hunger check of the Rouse check the wounds will

30:34 - heal okay you may get hungry you want to try all three at once or one at a time let's do all three at once

30:42 - Living Dangerously I've got two I'll also make attempt to

30:48 - [Laughter] empty

30:54 - park again so you unfortunately fortunately you can't get a special failure on a rouse check but how many

31:01 - failures are there all three three three so

31:06 - calling upon the power of your Vitae you successfully knit and mend the broken

31:13 - tissues and the shredded tendons and whatever displaced bones back together

31:19 - again feels good you make some of those weird snap crackle pop noises you know

31:24 - like when you used to go to the chiropractor but

31:31 - you gain three hunger for a total of

31:37 - four four my dear

31:44 - I'm famished so either call your little friends back

31:53 - and let's see if they're good to the last drop this time

31:59 - or maybe uh maybe Mr Ray or Miss Margo would oblige

32:08 - somebody's getting picky I'm hungry

32:13 - [Music] um maybe you should stay that way we'll see who gives in first

32:20 - [Laughter] are you feeling all right

32:26 - you look like [ __ ] I appreciate the honesty you just

32:33 - you're hungry aren't you I don't think I've ever been this hungry

32:39 - before Oh you don't need to do everything take them slow

32:46 - you can live with a little bit of pain but considering how you look now you should

32:53 - feed and we are not good

32:58 - choices wait is that on the table don't feed on me yeah I can cheat wait can she do that is

33:05 - that a thing you can absolutely feed on another Kindred oh my God if that was an option yeah

33:12 - don't what you smell that bag oh yeah hold on uh Hey refriger unrefrigerated

33:19 - blood that's like a week and a half old I hand her a scab in a bag

33:24 - well at one time it was a

33:30 - medical bag full of human blood but it's been in her giant purse as Margo says for a week

33:40 - it is possible that if you squeeze it and maybe even lick the insides out you

33:47 - might take away a hunger die okay at best I'm like cracking and popping it

33:53 - like a glow stick like hold on just give me like a second I don't like Messiah very much so I kind of want to do this

34:00 - it smells rank but it's still blood I'll

34:06 - take it you'll take it well fortunately

34:11 - for you it does satisfy one

34:18 - hunger die and you can decrease your hunger from the very

34:24 - dangerous and risky level of four down to three which is where you started this

34:30 - evening is that always the way huh how could you

34:35 - tasty stand that you dislike me but rear

34:43 - this this is disgusting did we not just have

34:49 - a conversation about self-worth and I offer her up my wrist hold on now

34:57 - I apologize go ahead Mark no glad uh yo really quick you know stuff about is

35:03 - this that feels you're making a face um

35:10 - it is a means to an end more than a convenient way of feeling

35:16 - I do it yeah don't do it every time just like special occasions and stuff like that this is it won't happen again this

35:23 - is prime rib right here look I'm usually not one to discourage

35:28 - anyone's path down um you discourage me from leveling buildings all the time I keep

35:35 - talking right in the pocket look if you feed on him you will be bound to him to a certain

35:42 - extent we already bound to each other

35:47 - the same way you're bound to your sire you will feel

35:52 - um beholden to him more than you may do just by knowing someone

35:57 - it is a way to control other kindred the same way that I gave my blood to my

36:03 - associates here it has a similar effect

36:08 - Argos certainly never covered this in fledgling 101. so each one of us is

36:15 - at least a little bit bound to the person who made us which is why we may have complicated

36:22 - feelings for that person oh but by all means you can do it if you

36:28 - feel in particular need to give yourself over to Rey I'm not going to tell you not to but I just wanted you to know all

36:34 - the details before you went in you can resist it you can

36:43 - work towards it not happening again but if repeated feedings happen then there

36:48 - can be verbals fine

36:59 - unfortunately

37:04 - taking more blood from your friends so soon

37:10 - could be risky to them and their health so

37:16 - there's plenty of people outside or we can just go pay Drexler a visit

37:22 - he's got a couple more bags it's also people we could just find

37:27 - people I want to get a move on well

37:33 - then why don't we go investigate this building and on the way we'll pick you up a snack

37:39 - huh seems like a much safer option we don't need to all be bound to each

37:44 - other is this someplace that you want

37:51 - Michael to drive you do you have a particular place you want to go

37:58 - um can we go could we go by the Dive Bar yeah we'll

38:05 - stop by the Dive Bar Louise yeah you

38:10 - so do I understand that you're sharing the vehicle together and that your ultimate destination is

38:18 - the skull place well if that's where we all want to go or someplace else yeah we can knock that

38:24 - out yeah pretty quickly right is this merely a stop on the way to that or do

38:30 - you have another destination in mind I believe we're stopping at Dooley's and then

38:36 - heading towards the condominium that is being built the tower the Crescent thank you yeah

38:47 - Michael's driving what about Angela

38:53 - she can come in the car but we don't need her to come in the building with us yet

38:59 - unless there's a problem I'd prefer her not to be in danger so full vehicle then yes

54:31 - welcome back to our vampire the Masquerade Chronicle New York by night season one episode five

54:40 - drawing Darkness and the Darkness is drawing close indeed for our codery as they arrive

54:48 - at a construction site and it shares many features in common with construction sites all over the world

54:54 - there is heavy machinery it is idle at this late hour

54:59 - giant cranes earth-moving equipment bulldozers Crux of various description

55:06 - there is a lot of raw Earth that's been churned up by the giant almost monstrous

55:13 - Treads of these machines and right on the Riverside

55:18 - on the bank itself is rising this huge

55:24 - vast luxurious Palace made up of

55:30 - when it is finished even smaller luxurious palaces

55:35 - there are large signs everywhere advertising the construction company the

55:40 - financial institutions that are funding the project advisories to wear hard hats

55:48 - and yes on the far side closest to the river furthest from you

55:54 - there is a crane operating and there are construction workers laboring late into

56:00 - the night very unusual that makes things more difficult

56:05 - it isn't impossible of course but it's expensive keep Crews operating 24 7. especially in

56:13 - New York City even in the Bronx and of course there are safety issues

56:20 - from where you've parked outside the chain link fence that

56:26 - surrounds the whole project you don't see any other people at this

56:32 - time just the distant little figures of the laborers

56:38 - working to move pipe paneling concrete Lumber

56:44 - high up a top the rising Towers

56:50 - it is very possible that we will not be able to find any way to enter into the

56:56 - lower levels of this we might have to go into the sewer system or something to find a way to get underneath here but it

57:04 - moves us to check it out

57:09 - unfortunately there are still workers here so that's going to make things a little difficult in the not being seen

57:15 - Department are there any animals around that's an interesting question

57:21 - you're strolling around perhaps looking for a natural uh way into the chain link

57:26 - fence unless you tend to jump over it there are always Rats of course in a

57:33 - city of this size and they're not difficult to find there is also

57:39 - as you notice improbably single Crow sitting on top of the chain

57:46 - link fence watching you with what seems like intent curiosity hmm now

57:55 - corvids are very intelligent birds and they use tools they can reason

58:04 - they generally do not fly at night hmm

58:09 - okay so there's a crow over there crows is smart

58:15 - they might know some stuff but I'm a little fuzzy right now of any specific questions

58:21 - that would be helpful in this situation that I should ask it um I would ask if it

58:28 - I don't know if a crow would pay attention but if it knows of a way to get Underground

58:34 - and has it seen anything hasn't seen any bones okay

58:40 - I'd like I think would be anything else anything else all right I'd like to activate feral Whispers I'm going to

58:47 - talk to it yes you're going to speak its language the language of the Corvettes

58:52 - which is of course involves a lot of cawing and croaking and strange noises they have a surprisingly big vocabulary

59:01 - what do you want to ask it I want to ask it um

59:07 - did you make your routes I did not yet no I don't get hungry

59:17 - um hello do you do you spend a lot of time here

59:26 - of course what you all hear Sarah making Crow noises

59:31 - the crow responds in the same language you of course hear it differently

59:37 - hello yourself um thank you so much uh have you have

59:43 - you been hanging out here much recently nope no you knew

59:54 - what are you hungry for eyes eyes

59:59 - huh that's that's challenging

1:00:04 - um how about uh what else do you eat

1:00:11 - can't I don't think I can promise you ice and I don't want to lie to you because I respect you

1:00:16 - wait wait it slaps its wings

1:00:24 - flies into the construction site a few moments later it returns

1:00:31 - but it's riding on the shoulder of somebody that you don't recognize

1:00:38 - what do they see coming out of the darkness on the other side of the fence

1:00:43 - you see someone and fluffy

1:00:49 - um collar their head is tilted down and all you see is the top brim of

1:00:57 - a bit of a cowboy hat um they're short and they walk with a bit

1:01:04 - of a Swagger then they lean up

1:01:12 - well this is new you picked the wrong Crow uh-huh

1:01:17 - okay my friend said you were asking questions not it disrespectfully no no no no no

1:01:24 - please that look I'm not looking for a fight this is fun who are you

1:01:30 - I'm serif like the font nice yeah I'm Bree Bree nice to meet you Bree I'm

1:01:42 - um do you live here no good

1:01:48 - do you no if I'm trespassing don't mind me does this technically fall within our

1:01:55 - territory it does it is technically our territory though oh

1:02:01 - apologies I was just sort of uh climbing around

1:02:06 - love a good construction site you know yeah I do how long have you been here

1:02:12 - tonight or have you visited other nights no no first time about an hour just

1:02:19 - fishing around for what fun hmm

1:02:26 - okay I kind of like her though thank you you're welcome have you seen any um

1:02:33 - points of entrance Underground sure there's loads of stuff under the city I mean in this site specifically

1:02:43 - have I yeah yeah hell yeah I have it's uh

1:02:48 - it would be almost impossible not to have underground access points in a project

1:02:54 - like this there's of course the underground parking garage that they're building there's all the tunnels and

1:03:02 - um rooms there build under the site there's conduits

1:03:07 - for plumbing and electrical and maintenance access yeah

1:03:14 - this is a skeleton there's lots of ways in great that's good to know would you mind showing us

1:03:22 - am I invited along for whatever's going on can I use awe again

1:03:28 - you can always use uh it's a free night

1:03:34 - the uh the power of course happens uh automatically

1:03:40 - it doesn't require a rouse check and it lasts for the entire scene so

1:03:45 - for your very eyes she becomes more alluring

1:03:52 - unswavel mind

1:03:57 - you can sense the resistance even though you are not actively trying to influence

1:04:03 - her emotions it isn't impossible but you'd have to work for it

1:04:10 - all right well why didn't you say so tonight's going to be a party so down we go yes if you'll be willing

1:04:18 - to assist us that would be lovely all right hey toots shall we and I pick up

1:04:25 - the The Crow and just send them off uh to lead the way

1:04:30 - all right chlo the crow uh flies to the end of the chain link fence where

1:04:35 - there's a section that isn't quite linked together that you can easily slip through ah I open it for you all thank

1:04:44 - you I've learned my lesson traveling with you three

1:04:53 - just gonna hang it on the fence yeah just on the inside of the fence

1:05:00 - could take any valuables from inside of it though yeah

1:05:08 - how long have you owned this place about a week

1:05:13 - well congratulations over the threshold we go hmm

1:05:22 - the construction site ground is of course mostly still fresh dirt if you're wearing awesome

1:05:29 - shoes they won't be awesome very long here God damn it this socks

1:05:37 - where did you think we were going to go no not through mud and [ __ ]

1:05:45 - um Crow seeing that you have giving yourself access to the

1:05:51 - construction site does as Aston flies in the direction of the skeleton

1:05:59 - what will one day be a building

1:06:04 - I'm curious to know did you just see this place and decide it was going to be fun to explore

1:06:11 - yeah I tend to like buildings that are pretty empty and it tends to draw a certain crowd

1:06:18 - hmm people like to hang out paint smoke

1:06:24 - fight you never know what kind of evening you're gonna have in a place

1:06:30 - like this I have one request yeah the three lovable goofballs spray painting

1:06:35 - some stuff leave them alone do I get the sense that she's telling the whole truth

1:06:41 - hmm well

1:06:47 - are you trying to read her tone her body language gut instinct yeah

1:06:55 - I don't think I'd be able to figure out what she's hiding but just if she's

1:07:04 - make it wits and insight

1:07:11 - as you're investigating Ray answers your question um I don't feed on goofballs

1:07:18 - I like that Bree what hunger are you at you're at one right I'm at one unless you want me to roll it

1:07:27 - only one success four she is unreadable to you

1:07:34 - I mean it is never foolproof trying to Divine someone's true intentions but you

1:07:39 - do know something of course about people who lie for a living given the profession that you

1:07:45 - have come from yeah but that's usually in brightly lit boardrooms not dark tunnels

1:07:52 - forgive me for all the questions it's just I'm sure no it's fine I'm in a social uh mood tonight I guess

1:08:00 - a lot of never quite can trust another kindred

1:08:06 - that's correct so what's up well we're here looking for something

1:08:11 - and supposed to be underneath this building oh treasure hey you could look at it

1:08:18 - like that we're on a treasure hunt great call me Captain

1:08:26 - Crow is leading you toward

1:08:31 - the almost cave-like entrance to the underground parking garage that first thing

1:08:37 - that they built it's all concrete and rebar but it is dark as the electric lights

1:08:44 - haven't been hung and connected yet Crow perches on a

1:08:50 - large clump of Earth that's been piled up here by machines huh

1:08:56 - well there was copper piping here about 30 minutes ago I guess someone got that

1:09:01 - thieves thieves thieves thieves indeed tooth sweet shiny no it never changes am

1:09:09 - I still able to hear tooths absolutely fantastic so your question hmm

1:09:15 - no I mean it was just we needed a way I know this seems to be a and

1:09:20 - access point to Underground hopefully can lead us to where we might be able to find what we're looking for so how do

1:09:27 - you know there's a buried treasure here we don't we have a rumor what do you know about the

1:09:35 - HMS hussar come again am I pronouncing that correctly you are

1:09:42 - it's a a ship was a ship supposedly lost underneath

1:09:49 - this area when it used to be water so you really are pirates

1:09:55 - are you guys don't dress like Pirates what's

1:10:01 - what's a lot of silk and Cashmere sir pirates dress in what they plunder

1:10:09 - wow I like him well considering it's going to be rather

1:10:23 - eyes are blood red they begin to Glow Isaac activates his

1:10:29 - can everyone [ __ ] do this no wild I activate eyes of the Beast God

1:10:35 - damn it do you want to just hold hands well I think it would behoove you to hold one of us considering you can't see

1:10:41 - if you both hold each other's hands you're going to get lost together all right all right I slip my arm underneath

1:10:47 - Isaac's arm thanks

1:10:53 - so three grabs your hand too all right we're doing this incredible

1:10:58 - let's go and see what we find Marco has two escorts to guide her steps maybe your shoes

1:11:12 - we don't come out in two hours that there is a problem

1:11:19 - text back her understanding also let Michael know to grab my jacket

1:11:25 - I let Michael know there's a jacket on the fence that needs to be grabbed Michael text back his understanding who are you

1:11:33 - talking to a wooden hanger if he's got it I don't send that message

1:11:39 - so what's your whole deal me yeah um specifically oh I don't know just

1:11:46 - tonight I guess I was kind of hoping I'd be hungry but

1:11:52 - I don't know this is kind of better

1:11:58 - never found treasure in this city like this well to be fair we've never found

1:12:03 - treasure in this city like this before either so um you could say we're

1:12:09 - on our first voyage we're gonna make ship puns the whole [ __ ] time why not okay okay gotta

1:12:16 - embrace the vibe I Love A vibe and I extend my thank yous again for

1:12:21 - letting me join and also letting me stamp on your ground and as she gestures you notice that

1:12:28 - breeze barefoot

1:12:35 - parking garage is vast cavernous

1:12:40 - space the roof upheld by a series of concrete pillars is for those of you without the

1:12:49 - means to see in the dark pitch black down here once you leave the

1:12:55 - entrance behind it's very difficult to see anything at

1:13:01 - all except the glowing red eyes of Isaac Ray and your

1:13:08 - new associate now those of you have just named can see

1:13:14 - perfectly down here there isn't much to see though

1:13:19 - it's a parking garage it just hasn't got any cars in it yet or any lights

1:13:25 - or any other amenities that you might find in such a place there are a number of doors of course that lead to

1:13:32 - elevators that don't work yet stairs that do probably at least one or two maintenance

1:13:39 - closets for access to Machinery but nothing that looks like what you came

1:13:46 - here to find and that is when the utter Blackness is

1:13:52 - pierced by flashlights that let you up

1:13:57 - those industrial halogen things that are very very bright

1:14:04 - what are you doing down here two men

1:14:10 - dressed in curity uniforms are Shining these bright lights at you

1:14:17 - it's difficult to see their features as they point the lights at you they're really in

1:14:23 - Darkness behind them but you can tell that one of them has a pistol pointed at you

1:14:30 - okay everybody start walking back towards the door nice and slow look buddy I'm just

1:14:38 - here hey take out my parking spot I didn't ask you man wait what what do you

1:14:43 - mean parking spot are you you see these down here

1:14:49 - these these these things and second Annie he's shiny of his light over there as if you're actually pointing something

1:14:55 - out and then that's the moment that's the moment you strike mm-hmm

1:15:01 - anybody else going in

1:15:07 - [Music] choosing one

1:15:12 - or are you tackling the same individual that we are

1:15:19 - yeah I think there's a bit of a unspoken connection that Ray didn't expect

1:15:25 - as the uh strategy plays out yeah I think she

1:15:30 - follows behind you at like the moment you leap she in tandem goes behind and

1:15:36 - then veers off to sort of flank with you um in an attempt to either get the

1:15:42 - second guard if they notice yeah or devour this one with you Isaac walks

1:15:47 - open grabs there he goes hand thank you just stay here they'll deal with it yeah

1:15:54 - yeah you still have your arm yes I have a hold of both of them okay

1:16:00 - so you maneuver quickly like

1:16:06 - a pair of wolves and circling your prey flashlights play crazily about

1:16:12 - your forms and the shadows and the pillars in the Darkness

1:16:21 - for you act first yeah yeah what do you do

1:16:27 - phrase hesitating on the first uh well you're a little busy you can't matter you can't care what Ray

1:16:33 - is doing

1:16:40 - the one who's holding I want him to shut up how are you gonna make him shut up

1:16:49 - are you attacking him yeah okay please make a dice pool

1:16:54 - strengthen Brawl for you unless you were using any of your Supernatural power not yet not yet these

1:17:03 - are just guards that's six seven dice one of which is your hunger

1:17:08 - die I'll roll four security guard and Ray I'm just looking

1:17:14 - at knock that one out okay strength and Brawl for you

1:17:19 - Humane wowza hmm how many ox

1:17:25 - so this is not a good roll y'all don't don't move the dice yet we'll see if we

1:17:31 - can improve the situation okay right I only have one success

1:17:36 - okay uh apparently these security guards are better trained than you anticipated

1:17:43 - spend willpower to uh re-roll any of the dice I'm gonna go ahead and spend that

1:17:49 - willpower okay so you take a point of superficial willpower damage you can re-roll any of the black dice that came

1:17:56 - up failures how's it going let me know what you got are you doing good now breathe how many ounces did you get I

1:18:01 - got one knock one knock and what's the what's on the hunger die uh that it is on the hunger die okay

1:18:07 - that's still a success yeah even though it's on the Hungry Die but right nothing else nothing else

1:18:18 - do you want to redouble your effort do you want to spend uh willpower yes okay you can re-roll up to three of those

1:18:24 - black dice that came up blank

1:18:30 - okay antiox there two successes total or two more two more hmm well apparently these

1:18:38 - security guards have been taking I don't know maybe Judo classes or boxing at the

1:18:44 - local gym because the attack doesn't go as well as you had hoped the one with

1:18:51 - the gun Ducks Dodges weaves and then fires straight it's so sweaty

1:19:00 - gets off a couple of shots right in your direction the bullets slam into your

1:19:05 - Undead flesh and thanks to your preternatural fortitude

1:19:11 - they don't do much damage to you they're more irritating than anything but they do stop you cold in your tracks

1:19:17 - he looks really surprised that you just didn't sit down on the floor when those slugs hit you right

1:19:24 - the guard you're attacking doesn't have a gun but he's using his flashlight to block your blows and defend you he's

1:19:30 - clearly had some fight training he is able to damage You by catching you

1:19:35 - on the side of the head with his flashlights one of those heavy duty aluminum things and you take uh incoming

1:25:37 - no it's a threat I don't ever want him to speak again

1:25:44 - so you are hurting him yes badly yes

1:25:52 - he will lose consciousness very quickly he might die without medical attention

1:25:58 - you're not a doctor it's hard to say he already called for help um

1:26:04 - well this is a mess

1:26:10 - Isaac has turned around and walked out of the garage

1:26:19 - let's find another hole we got some bodies to get rid of don't we

1:26:24 - this has been quite an evening and you can see that she has time where her

1:26:30 - shirt is now ripped from The Bullet Hole she's just tying it shut I really like this shirt too let's uh

1:26:39 - check some convictions here

1:26:45 - you successfully resisted the temptation to be the Beast stayed the human yeah so look how

1:26:52 - successful I was if you have

1:26:58 - maintained your Humanity Margo

1:27:08 - your convictions about your family and protecting the Bronx don't seem to apply here

1:27:16 - but the chronicle tenets for both of you and for Brie

1:27:22 - Justice must be served and stand your ground stirred your ground

1:27:29 - but was it justice was it just it's a question that we can answer at a

1:27:36 - later time when things are calmer in the meantime as I say

1:27:42 - you have a mess Isaac has walked toward the entrance

1:27:50 - doesn't take long to reach you what about you Seraph I follow Isaac out follow Isaac out

1:27:58 - take the radio and turn it off off of the guy I shot take his radio and his

1:28:03 - flashlight take the radio turn it off and take his heavy duty very bright flashlight

1:28:14 - 's still down on the ground where the last guard was

1:28:20 - and just says we didn't need to kill anybody

1:28:28 - his heart's still beating can't you feel it his isn't

1:28:34 - no but you didn't pull the trigger

1:28:42 - what's wrong

1:28:48 - we all fight being monsters

1:28:54 - every night just

1:29:01 - it just feels like you let it win every now and then when something like this happens

1:29:06 - that's life yeah I didn't say it was uh yeah

1:29:12 - easy or Fair just sucks when it happens

1:29:18 - I I want to fish in uh the pockets I want to find his wallet the one that was shot what's that easily

1:29:24 - done yeah um I pull out his ID I hand it to you

1:29:31 - his name's Brian if you want to send flowers to his family make yourself feel better I'll add them to the list

1:29:38 - I take the cash wasn't much there people tend to use plastic these days I don't need a lot

1:29:45 - okay at the entrance

1:29:51 - to the parking garage Isaac is scanning the rest of the

1:29:59 - uh the area to see if anyone came running after multiple gunshots and they help escaped on the radio

1:30:08 - which you can see from the entrance to the garage is that the crane has stopped operating

1:30:16 - do not see the people who are working in that part of the construction site any

1:30:21 - longer we need to be more careful

1:30:31 - that was great delicious thank you you're welcome yeah

1:30:36 - thanks no problem we should leave is this bad is this bad for you guys

1:30:43 - yes do you need a distraction we haven't

1:30:49 - found the treasure yet you haven't but there's not really many other entry entrances in here so if

1:30:55 - we're going up we're likely to run into somebody else you may have been fortunate

1:31:01 - gunshots deep underground in the parking garage mine have gone unnoticed at least for

1:31:07 - now Radio Calls for help though bullet wounds in a body though

1:31:13 - well of course when those bodies are found they will give you a great deal of attention did you um

1:31:20 - take care of those bodies so you're just going to leave them

1:31:25 - just leave them what are you going to do you killed them you need to take care of them what if we made it look like they

1:31:33 - killed each other that's going to be difficult considering the wounds that were applied yeah

1:31:40 - I don't know what to do how do you I don't I've never hit a body before but you could really consider that before you kill I say you find a hole look look

1:31:50 - we are looking for a ship full of bodies that have never been found

1:31:57 - so you want to drag the corpses around them with us until we find that ship a little bit further at least Beyond

1:32:04 - where the development is great and go get them what the hell is

1:32:10 - going on here yeah yeah turn around who is it

1:32:16 - it's two more people man and a woman the man is dressed in

1:36:54 - now can I smell if there's like fresh concrete somewhere just bored because they need to be taken care of hmm

1:37:00 - it's a construction site yeah and your Crow

1:37:06 - is probably the best Scout available to you it wouldn't be hard to find fresh concrete my sweet

1:37:13 - you got it let's slay some more bones for them to

1:37:18 - find in the distant future unless we want to take one to the hospital

1:37:28 - this is not a judgment I'm being serious you seem very conflicted

1:37:37 - it doesn't take long for your Crow to return to let you know where to look for what

1:37:43 - you want we have a burial spot

1:37:49 - how many bones are going in the ground there's only one set of Bones going in

1:37:55 - the ground I'll take the other guy up on my back and start to walk out

1:38:02 - I'll go get the corpse

1:38:09 - Margo you're helping Bree

1:38:18 - okay wow that is happening Seraph and Isaac are doing what I'm

1:38:25 - gonna go with Rey I'm gonna go with Ray remember that that man has seen all of

1:38:31 - our faces so when he regains Consciousness he remembers Who We Are

1:38:37 - and that we were here just so you're aware

1:38:48 - the body disappears to the wet cement which will soon be dry

1:38:54 - it's like it was never here Ray what do you do with the wounded

1:39:00 - Security card still alive as far as you can tell yeah I don't know yet

1:39:06 - I'm just walking if you can just trying to keep

1:39:12 - someone alive you don't have medical training so

1:39:19 - you can try a rudimentary first aid taken back out by the fence

1:39:36 - there are two other options available to you

1:39:42 - yeah yeah any options I can think of

1:39:50 - you've had a recent discussion about ghouls

1:39:56 - and it is possible that the properties of the vitae

1:40:02 - vampiric body could work their Supernatural trick on

1:40:07 - him and maybe save his life but

1:40:12 - that carries with it additional complications the other

1:40:19 - is what happened to you

1:40:26 - I said that I wanted him alive so you've only given me one option

1:40:34 - you're not sure how long he'll live I you could in fact of course call for an

1:40:40 - ambulance and leaving one here would be found you could take him to a hospital

1:40:50 - I lay him down against one of the walls Sarah still with me yeah it was dark he

1:40:55 - didn't really see us all that great wow he had a flashlight

1:41:00 - he looked at all of us but a lot of people see things

1:41:08 - I'm just saying don't let what Isaac said I'll give a slice to my wrist

1:41:17 - and kind of hold it towards him and give one look at Seraph and be like

1:41:25 - is one way we sure that he says what we want him to say

1:41:31 - and that he stays alive I'm gonna go

1:41:37 - had a Libre on his own to do it Bree where are you

1:41:44 - um I'm uh with Mark Margot you have finished disposing yeah of the body

1:41:55 - yeah so what was that

1:42:03 - was going to be koi look

1:42:08 - think I don't like being told what to do

1:42:14 - yeah hey that's not a bad trait means you don't take [ __ ]

1:42:24 - I don't think I do hmm your friends really sensitive

1:42:33 - right yeah yeah

1:42:39 - he's a he's a good guy

1:42:46 - how long have you been like this

1:42:53 - a little over three years does it get easier

1:43:02 - wow depends on which part the hunger

1:43:09 - never but I mean

1:43:16 - we all get Delta card and we can play it how we wish this is who I am

1:43:23 - and I [ __ ] love it because no one can tell me what the [ __ ]

1:43:29 - to do no one can prey on me because that is

1:43:36 - what I do and I don't take that for granted okay I think I cut you off and kiss you

1:43:43 - oh I kiss you right back share a moment

1:43:51 - sorry hey don't apologize I like people that

1:43:57 - know what they want

1:44:02 - feels good right

1:44:08 - there are a lot of things better than sex

1:44:14 - the most interesting thing you've said to me all night it's at this point that you are Crow

1:44:21 - finds you Bree lands on your shoulder to whisper in your ear

1:44:26 - people people people people people people okay okay I take your hand

1:44:32 - grab right I'm gonna push on like the small of your back people people yeah she is happily led oh boy as far as you

1:44:39 - can tell Margo the crow is just making Crow noises yes squat car

1:44:45 - Ray

1:44:55 - your Vitae does what you wanted it to do

1:45:00 - you can tell that he's going to make it he may not wake up immediately

1:45:09 - but when he does he'll be changed before I leave

1:45:15 - grab his name tag it will be easy for you to find him

1:45:21 - again foreign that's it

1:45:28 - so

1:45:35 - regrouping at the van or elsewhere Isaac is standing on the corner where we

1:45:41 - came in waiting for everyone to finish what they were doing Rey's code is still hanging there

1:46:56 - so let me understand are we going Separate Ways sounds like we are it sounds like Rey

1:47:03 - Isaac and your employees Isaac are leaving in your vehicle and going

1:47:11 - elsewhere it sounds like Margot and Sarah for doing

1:47:16 - something else you like being in

1:47:26 - and you're sticking around with them for a bit longer breathe yeah why not uh I at least when you kiss a girl you

1:47:34 - gotta at least walk her home right

1:48:13 - that we find these things what around what time is it

1:48:22 - it's after midnight round one you have a few hours until the Sun's Up

1:48:31 - decisions decisions um while you're thinking about it

1:48:52 - they're not vampires who say that I uh I I punch a wall

1:49:04 - okay are you

1:57:08 - while in the van to be

1:57:14 - um so what did you do

1:57:21 - how did you fix it before that

1:57:28 - question what hey Michael sir

1:57:34 - can he ever make you normal again

1:57:41 - Michael is driving and his eyes search for yours in the

1:57:47 - rearview mirror as if to ask should I answer I'm not asking him I'm asking you can he

1:57:54 - make you normal I don't work for you you can't order me around you can't order me to do anything

1:58:02 - sir but you can ask

1:58:07 - that is what I'm [ __ ] doing you can answer them Michael

1:58:14 - my understanding is that should he

1:58:20 - decide not to allow me a drink

1:58:29 - at least once every month or so that I will be as I was

1:58:36 - that's not what I want it gets a little complicated the longer

1:58:41 - they exist with you look I'm not asking what you want I'm asking if it's possible it's absolutely possible if you

1:58:47 - don't give them any more blood he'll just revert back to how he was now I offer you all the three of you an

1:58:55 - intense amount of hospitality you were never to speak to Michael like that again you were to respect the fact that I let

1:59:02 - you into my house and I have shared all of these things with you believe me

1:59:09 - with more respect than you deserve in less respect than I'm capable of

1:59:19 - you don't control me I don't but I expect you to be polite

1:59:24 - I did nothing to you this evening everything that happened to you three did on your own I did not lift a finger to cause any problems I watched all of

1:59:32 - you do that on your own why are you mad at me

1:59:43 - this is not the situation I thought I'd find myself in neither is it mine

1:59:50 - but I'm making the best of it I hate to break it to you but some of us

1:59:56 - just have more of a problem looking on the bright side

2:00:02 - there is no bright side we lost the bright side we don't get to be in the sun anymore

2:00:08 - there isn't a bright side to anything you just have to be okay with living in the dark

2:00:14 - and if you're not that's a problem yeah I'm learning that

2:00:23 - foreign you've saved his life you can never talk to him again although

2:00:28 - he will look for you and he will go back to normal in about a month but if you feel some sort of

2:00:34 - responsibility to him you may want to look him up and speak to him although he will want to

2:00:41 - please you and do whatever you say it would probably if you don't want the

2:00:47 - responsibility of taking care of him it is best to just let him revert back to normal

2:00:55 - well you're saying you don't want a security guard in the new uh high-rise I choose my servants very

2:01:06 - it's a lot to think about a lot to weigh

2:01:11 - trying to find the line every night between human and the Beast is hard enough

2:01:19 - but it almost seems like the night is determined

2:01:25 - to make that process even harder than it has to be

2:01:30 - so with these thoughts on our conscience

2:01:36 - this seems like an excellent place to pause our vampire story for now
