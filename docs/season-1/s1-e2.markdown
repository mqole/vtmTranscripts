2:18 - back blaze the cloud storage and data backup company

2:23 - that preserves even the second inquisition's information from disaster and remember

2:29 - yev is canon

2:37 - we mentioned this a few moments ago the protagonists

2:42 - of our story are fledgling vampires these are the kindred embraced within

2:49 - the last few years the very lowest ranking on the list of kindred

2:55 - the very bottom of the blood rich and bittersweet layer cake that is kindred

3:01 - society they're not even neonates not yet

3:07 - so as fledglings they must learn how to contain their beasts

3:12 - how to navigate these nights and survive as kindred before they can worry about making uh

3:19 - high status moves and political waves right well maybe

3:25 - but fledglings are often under the nominal guidance of an older vampire

3:30 - older kindred maybe an adoptive ward figure or a mentor or an actual sire

3:37 - to show them the ropes and help them survive their first nights after the embrace

3:43 - those without that advantage on the other hand or who are left abandoned by a sire

3:51 - are sometimes illegal embraces in the camarilla court and more often than not

3:56 - face the final death at the hands of the prince's enforcers

4:01 - or they must find shelter among the anarch movement or try to survive solo

4:10 - and all the while they have to reconcile what they were

4:15 - with what they are now and this is maybe the biggest curse of existence at this bottom layer of the

4:22 - cake we can imagine it right the broadest layer of the confection

4:27 - it's holding up all the weight of the tears above it these vampires are this close to still

4:35 - being human their um lives might have started two weeks ago or two years ago but

4:42 - here their human life still lurks nearby as a reminder

4:49 - of what they've lost and at this stage of their existence

4:55 - and the bottom layer of the cake ignorance is not bliss

5:02 - with this firmly in mind let's tell a vampire story

5:20 - [Music]

5:48 - [Music]

5:57 - [Music]

6:10 - [Music]

6:23 - [Music]

6:34 - where are we imagine it with us it's late in the evening in new york

6:41 - city and we're down by the riverside again the cold dark east river that

6:46 - slithers around the shore of the south bronx its surface

6:51 - deceptively calm but hiding churning turmoil beneath

6:58 - ready to drag an unwary swimmer down at the bottom the wind off the river is cold

7:04 - kind of cold that slices through that winter coat

7:09 - spring might be close but you would never know it tonight

7:14 - now picture with us a car sleek sedan

7:20 - pulling into the club parking lot crowded with dead things

7:25 - they don't breathe they don't blink but they do think and move and they've just completed an errand

7:32 - for richter the vampire crime boss who claims to run south bronx

7:39 - it was a simple errand right jack on a lick who is behind in his rent

7:46 - give him a message get a response report back but it's like so much else

7:51 - that involves kindred simplicity went out the window almost immediately

7:57 - instead it was a brief chaotic confrontation with mortals who evidently work for some

8:04 - other kindred the discovery of many little bits of pieces of information that doesn't

8:09 - really make sense yet own violence and blood

8:15 - there was definitely blood now you've returned to where the night

8:21 - began the cage richard's nightclub built in the shell of an old cement factory

8:27 - that looms over the river shore and even from the car as you arrive it's easy to see that the party inside

8:34 - is in full swing the parking lot is crowded with vehicles of every description people are congregating in

8:39 - pairs and groups around the building talking smoking laughing texting flirting

8:47 - some of them sway or nod to the base that the dj inside is pumping out and you can imagine the very

8:52 - bricks of the building vibrating with it even from here

8:58 - you have your disgusting trophy and plastic bag

9:03 - you have the briefcase yes that you retrieve from the thugs

9:10 - you have a bullet wound ow and a bullet

9:16 - isaac your driver parks the car and a few minutes later you're standing in the parking lot the cage facing the club

9:23 - you're back to the river what would you like to do

9:29 - are you just going to leave that hole in you oh

9:34 - i should probably patch that up huh it's up to you you're not going to die from it but it

9:40 - is unsightly that's gross can i amend that please you can

9:47 - absolutely mend it so you're not impaired at all right

9:53 - no nothing at all so you can heal your dead flesh

9:58 - make a rouse check uh failure

10:07 - well the wound knits closed anyway

10:13 - it's kind of a weird sensation to feel the skin regrow and sort of pull itself together

10:18 - not unpleasant but very weird

10:24 - have you ever been shot before you know i don't get out much no but you should get out more yeah

10:32 - maybe time for a snack inside don't you think yes yes yes yes snacks several sacks

10:39 - all the snacks my child i guess

10:44 - time's wasting yeah

10:51 - ah sorry i uh yeah i know no i haven't gotten shot before weird

10:56 - strange yeah it's not a um

11:02 - not a common feeling have you been shot yeah

11:07 - okay in your line of work it's your line of work now too

11:14 - that's a good point have you been shot i've gone through a few suits yeah

11:22 - can i activate blush of life as i like you certainly can't get into the mood and to do that you must also rouse the

11:28 - blood so let's make a rouse check i'm hungrier you're hungrier everyone's

11:35 - matching me someone's hungry you hear voice

11:41 - in the back of your head the voice you hear whenever the beast stirs inside you

12:45 - club goers are dressed in all manner of attire some have gone for the very classic you know leather pants and not a

12:52 - lot else and some of them are dressed in very dayglow colors more appropriate to a rave maybe

12:59 - there's a lot of cigarette smoke and cigar smoke and clothes and other kind of smoke from other

13:05 - substances and there are plenty of substances being traded back and forth illicitly

13:12 - through outstretched hands the side door is still open as well the loading zone where you entered the last

13:18 - time that the band uses and now that they're you can see there are posters plastered

13:24 - near the front doors advertising tonight's band bronx cheer looks like a

13:30 - trio of musicians but impossible to tell what kind of music that they might play from the poster

18:33 - appreciate it i appreciate it they can get a little rowdy sometimes yeah i like rowdy normally i like it but now that

18:39 - exchange did not go unnoticed and some of the other mortals who were gathered around outside the club

18:45 - paying attention to you wondering who you are that they singled you out and shouted your name

18:53 - no one's taking a picture of you yet but it's only a matter of time we should probably get inside okay fine

18:59 - yeah you want to head in yes okay hey maybe you take the suit jacket

19:05 - off oh man i guess you know i'm just going to have to take a few things out of it

19:11 - first yeah we can do that take your jacket off yep

19:19 - there's a coat check or something i assume there's no bouncer you think there's a

19:24 - coach well i assume that the guy in the leather pants and no shirt showed up with something on

19:31 - to begin with no man this is what i'm wearing what god dammit

19:36 - nice tie hey there you go nice tie

19:42 - i know all right are we yeah are we straight

19:48 - for richter or are we like do we go oh we could do a lap we could do a lab

19:54 - we could it's i doubt we can get up to richter without him knowing we're here so we'll

20:00 - once we're in there i'm sure he'll know we're there yeah okay oh people are moving in and out of the doors like hmm

20:08 - like fishing schools upstream downstream in out swirling massive humanity immediately on

20:15 - the inside of course is that big cavernous dance floor that used to be the central part of the factory and that

20:21 - strange metal cage thing suspended precariously above the floor on chains that people

20:28 - are now occupying very likely beyond the legal limit of what it could actually carry

20:34 - it's swaying back and forth as they dance and climb around it like some sort of

20:39 - weird piece of playground equipment and if somebody doesn't fall off that thing tonight you will be amazed

20:47 - now the dj he's keeping the crowd warmed up with an eclectic mix of music

20:53 - spotlights reds yellows blues built into these weird cylinders and it

20:59 - takes you a moment to realize that they're attached to old cement mixers

21:05 - are rotating around and the dj has chosen to put staccato machine gun sounds

21:11 - into almost all of his mix it's a strange vibe

21:17 - place is crowded though it does good business hmm

21:24 - where to let's do a lap and look for consuela mm-hmm

21:30 - uh i'm gonna listen out into the conversations uh

21:35 - to see if we uh hear any mention of callahan

21:40 - recent power shift okay

21:46 - staying together or going your separate ways hmm i'll do a lot with you yeah of

21:51 - course yeah who's got the plastic bag it's in my purse where the granola bar used to be

21:58 - and the briefcase it's in my car with michael with michael got it

22:07 - just let me make a note

22:13 - okay most of the individuals in the club most

22:18 - of these party goers are mortal so most of the conversation you pick up on at least for now is about how excited

22:24 - people are to see bronx cheer during the final set of the night everybody's looking forward to it

22:31 - and the conversation is primarily about mundane items you haven't heard anything

22:36 - pertaining to kindred just yet but keep your ears open and that might change

22:41 - start to make my way towards uh i know it's not directly accessible from

22:47 - here but some of the doors that i know lead to the tanning room the uh fight club that

22:54 - we won't talk about those kind of areas well you did get the grand tour earlier this evening so you

23:02 - know in the general direction where those things are and you make your way over that way right mm-hmm

23:10 - and also as soon as i'm no longer uh walking with fuego i

23:17 - foolishly realize why why the hell did i take off my jacket [Laughter]

23:26 - fuego seems to uh you know have that effect on she has that effect on a lot of people

23:31 - so maybe it's not entirely your fault right

23:40 - when you reach the stair landing that you know leads down

23:46 - to the lower levels your path is blocked by air box

23:52 - he's just coming up the stairs even on the stairs below you he's taller

24:00 - he's still wearing his shirt that says stay relevant he nods at you

24:07 - no good place to get a drink around here is there

24:13 - well i can't very well order it this bar hmm

24:20 - i feel sorry for you well you could make it easier just by

24:26 - pointing me in the right direction unless of course you mean something else i have a feeling you do

24:32 - you don't get it yet no but i'm sure someone's gonna take the

24:38 - time to explain it to me in a long and boring fashion i doubt it

24:45 - you're either going to get it or you don't it's just one loss after another for us

24:50 - man sacrifice after sacrifice sure are you sure no one's gonna want to explain it

24:56 - what about richter he likes the sound of his own voice you really like to interrupt people when they talk

25:06 - i'm sorry continue with your well thought out monologue

25:11 - no i think it'll be more fun for you to find out for yourself don't say i didn't try to help you you

25:17 - can get a drink on the floor if you're careful downstairs if you're not

25:25 - now get out of my way i'll let him walk by he passes you and goes

25:31 - the upstair way out on the floor i'm going to be following them behind

25:37 - just watching what they do mm-hmm now

25:43 - fuego ah remains activated for the scene so until

25:50 - you don't want it anymore you've got it and the mortals notice

25:57 - you are the center of attention in every throng of people you pass through

26:03 - everybody wants to know who she is tonight sorry were you trying to keep a low

26:08 - profile because i'm not no okay cool uh i am keeping an eye out i just want

26:15 - to spot the most attractive person here gender agnostic because i'm hungry

26:21 - because you're hungry so you're on the hunt always this is a hunt

26:26 - okay it doesn't take long some of their approaches are really

26:32 - terrible but that isn't related to their attractiveness and the individual you choose

26:40 - hard to say what gender they might be maybe whatever they feel like at the moment i'll love that for them

26:47 - hey i'm gonna oh you're here too i'll be back in

26:54 - 20 minutes okay okay bye

26:59 - you want to get out of here do i want to get out of here yeah do you want to get out of here

27:05 - oh i love answering your question with the question come on whoever they are

27:12 - they're used to the attention they're confident practically strut with you

27:19 - make it look good where are you uh hoping to go

27:25 - uh i think i want to try to dance out this song with them

27:31 - and then pull them to a secluded corner as secluded as it gets in a club

27:37 - because i'm a very specific predator child privacy is useful

27:44 - yeah when you're trying to stick to a diet it's not always easy is it yeah okay let

27:50 - me all start off you dance out

27:56 - start looking for a private secluded place meanwhile seraph and isaac

28:02 - do you have a type yeah people who like me you that makes sense

28:08 - i prefer to have them need something from me oh

28:15 - that's interesting how do you tend to get people to owe you stuff

28:20 - depends on the situation depends on who i'm talking to and where we are and what sort of dealings we have

28:27 - um can you be less picky for tonight i don't have to do it that way i just like to do it

28:33 - because i'm pretty hungry then do you want to share one

28:40 - that's not really my thing but remember to be careful that we are not on our territory that's a good point

28:46 - well we don't have any territory we don't and the reason that our friend fuego

28:52 - was here in the first place is that she fed on someone in richter's terrace oh

28:58 - man there's so many rules there are aren't there then maybe i'll wait probably a good idea

29:04 - but if you were to pick one

29:10 - i point to a rather

29:15 - nervous looking man across the dance floor

29:20 - who looks completely out of place and like he's drowning

29:27 - and out of his element i go that he needs something yeah or do you think he got dragged here

29:34 - i think he came here because he wanted to feel important or desired or something of

29:41 - that effect maybe to boost his self-esteem and it has had the opposite effect and it

29:47 - he now needs to be rescued oh i'm not going to do it but that's what

29:54 - he needs hmm you're a very astute observer of people i watch a lot of people

30:02 - it's at this point when two familiar individuals catch your eyes

30:09 - over at the long bar with its incredibly high almost towering glass shelves

30:15 - full of every possible kind of liquor imaginable

30:21 - at one end of the bar staring straight at you isaac is lizzy

30:27 - the kindred you met upstairs with richter she of the long talon-like claws

30:34 - she's changed her wardrobe though and she's no longer wearing a tattered

30:41 - dirty dior now she's wearing tattered dirty chanel

30:47 - on the other end of the long bar consuela

30:53 - she's engaged in a very long intense discussion with the bartender that you can't overhear from

30:59 - where you are you're not sure if she's noticed you yet i think it would be hoover's dr consuela

31:05 - when we have everybody with us so why don't we wait for a moment i think i'm going to go have a chat with lizzy

31:10 - because it amuses me that she's so uncomfortable in my presence can i use cloak of shadows and eavesdrop

31:16 - hmm tempting but cloak of shadows allows you to remain hidden

31:22 - only if you remain completely still in the shadows so if you can maneuver away to where

31:29 - they are find some shadow and stay inside it definitely you've got a shot at it

31:36 - hold that thought ray unless by some miracle i catch lizzie

31:43 - and consuela at the bar as well i think i'm headed downstairs

31:49 - well from the stairway you know your way at least to the entrance to the corridor you remember what's down there

31:56 - long hallways brick tunnels storage rooms lot of doors

32:02 - the pit the tank salon under construction pit

32:09 - check in on it yeah give it a look there's only one

32:14 - person in there at the moment middle-aged man wearing workman's coveralls

32:21 - a lot of tools and different pockets he's busy installing a guard railing around

32:28 - the edge of the pit he's having a hard time with it because it's extremely heavy reinforced steel

32:35 - obviously meant to make sure that people in the bleacher seats don't force their way into the fighting

32:41 - he looks up as you approach okay

32:47 - everything going well yeah uh something i can do for you no just

32:53 - checking if everything's still on schedule here yeah we're gonna we're gonna be open uh next week i promise um

33:00 - i'm sorry about the delays it it wasn't my fault i mean not freight shipping don't worry about it shipping is crazy

33:06 - right now we understand just figure out how far back we were what do you think what do you think

33:13 - does it look right i think it's exactly what we designed i don't know if that's exactly what we want what's gonna happen

33:19 - in here i mean is this like mma stuff or what it's

33:24 - more of an experimental thing um you know between you and me i don't have

33:30 - total faith in it but uh we'll see how it works man are we gonna get paid

33:35 - yeah absolutely again it's exactly what we asked for i just don't know if it's what we want

33:42 - you know how it goes i mean people not really but well

33:47 - you did what you were asked to do cool no no no you're all right

33:55 - yeah a little hungry but uh oh hey i got like uh

34:01 - i got like a choc cheese in my uh lunch pail no i think i'll actually uh it's

34:08 - good grab something else that's from a place on 133rd

34:14 - no i'm good have it your way more for me

34:21 - uh and i'm just gonna take a kind of quick lap around here take a look at you know i'm sure there's kind of like is it

34:27 - all general admission high stakes boxes kind of being built anywhere that uh richter

34:35 - would have his uh kind of higher end uh friends sitting

34:41 - in the arena you mean in the uh yeah in the surrounding area it's uh it's a lot more like uh it's a lot more like a

34:47 - roman coliseum all open everybody on the same kind of bleacher seats except for the very very top the

34:54 - highest tier four or five rows up there is a sort of a an area that's set aside

34:59 - still open not enclosed but clearly meant for people who are set apart from the

35:04 - crowd of fight goers i'll uh start to make a note of where

35:10 - the entrance to that is i'm assuming there's a separate entrance from there is yes that

35:15 - and then kind of see if i can backtrack to a uh fire exit

35:21 - there and just keep a mental note of fire exit to box entrance what are you planning

35:28 - ray i'm planning on knowing as much as i can about what is eventually going to happen here

35:34 - are you expecting trouble it doesn't hurt to have information

35:42 - meanwhile in a dark secluded room

35:47 - on the main floor with a lockable door

35:54 - fuego has a chance to satisfy her hunger

36:00 - your partner is willing

36:05 - how much of their blood do you take

36:10 - while you're in their arms now you were a two-hunger is that right

36:16 - yeah you can satisfy all the hunger you want you can

36:23 - be full but as you know the only way

36:28 - to completely sate your appetite is to take their life

36:36 - but the choice is yours this is pretty secluded this is as secluded as it's going to get

36:43 - in this building the door is locked it appears to be some sort of

36:48 - maybe it was a green room at one time for the bands there's even a couch

36:57 - and do i already have confirmation that they're they're from the bronx

37:04 - they're from belmont up north by riverdale okay near arthur avenue

37:10 - no i need to keep them around born and raised okay uh just one

37:15 - just one just one so but i'm gonna use lingering kiss

37:24 - it never gets old the bite the taste the delicious succulents of the blood

37:32 - as it cascades over your fangs and onto your tongue and down your throat

37:38 - it's the only thing that tastes good anymore it's liquid fire

37:44 - spicy and warm for the first time tonight

37:52 - you feel something other

37:59 - than confusion and uncertainty there's a special taste

38:06 - to their blood something that you haven't sampled before

38:12 - that spice i mentioned it's like cinnamon paprika and red peppers all at once

38:22 - fills you full of confidence and power

38:29 - and you know that somehow instinctually

38:34 - the next time that you want to appeal to the emotions of others

38:40 - it's going to be good take away a hunger die please you are at

38:46 - one you spared their life

38:54 - when we are finished uh

39:00 - fuego just leans into their ear what is your name

39:08 - you can call me shy shy yeah it's with an e

39:16 - okay what's your name what do i call you and how do i find you again that was

39:22 - i know that was i know you are um

39:28 - i can't i've never give me your phone and i go and like rifle through their clothes

39:35 - i'll just find it and i'll put my number in there you'll put your number in

39:42 - stretch out on the couch lingerously relaxing in the bliss of it

39:48 - you are delightful you're gonna call me right you know i am i'm going to call you

39:57 - don't be shy i see what you did there

40:02 - kernin leaf at the bar

40:10 - at the bar um i'm gonna go find somewhere dark and

40:15 - i don't want to hear this conversation you want to overhear what they're saying and you want to do it surreptitiously so

40:21 - that you're not noticed do i have that right correct well let's resolve that first it takes some maneuvering because of

40:28 - course there are a lot of people here and you're not supposed to be behind the bar

40:33 - but let's make the roll anyway now normally

40:38 - you wouldn't have to do this but since you were trying in very very difficult circumstances

40:45 - to accomplish something like this let's make the roll hmm

40:51 - let's make it dexterity and stealth it's a pretty good pool for you but

40:57 - because of the crowded conditions on all the eyes around you

41:02 - i'm gonna take away two dice okay um

41:08 - okay wait yes thank you okay

41:16 - uh four uh two uh sorry two six six uh you had a

41:23 - you know you had a you had a critical success yeah not a messy critical but a critical success yes

41:30 - improbably against all the odds you choose the exact moment when

41:35 - nobody is looking at that dark corner by the service door accessed downstairs

41:41 - behind the bar you step into those shadows and you might as well not be there as

41:49 - far as anyone else is concerned now you can't move from that spot

41:54 - without breaking the obfuscate but as long as you stand in there and as long as

42:00 - isaac and lizzie don't go anywhere else you'll be able to overhear what they say

42:06 - as you approach isaac lizzie who is leaning against the bar

42:12 - facing the dance floor tries to back up away from you but the bar's in the way so she can't

42:17 - and so instead she just peers at you through her long stringy hair in fact she's only appearing at you

42:23 - with one eye because the hair is covering the other half of her face lizzy was it

42:32 - yes nice to see you again

42:37 - isaac yes

42:44 - how are you i'm fine we've uh

42:52 - the place is much more lively than it was the last time we were earlier this evening but it's nice lively you like it

43:00 - it's not generally where i hang out but it's nice i don't like it

43:05 - why it's noisy it's hard to think it is that

43:12 - what are you sorry

43:17 - how can i help you oh she seems pleased with herself to have

43:22 - remembered that good um i don't particularly need anything i just saw you at the bar and i

43:30 - noticed that i make you a little uncomfortable

43:36 - why i know what you are

43:43 - that's fair i have no reason you shouldn't be uncomfortable i have no

43:50 - reason to do anything and i don't particularly pose much of a danger so there shouldn't really be a

43:56 - problem i don't believe you well

44:02 - i remember the fiends the black hand the sword of cain

44:08 - i remember what you did to this city

44:14 - that wasn't me how do i know that

44:19 - that happened a long time ago i've only been around for a small number of years

44:25 - blood is blood you can't help it well what i want to know is

44:34 - can you do the thing that's a vague question

44:40 - i mean you are a smitsy

44:47 - can you do the thing i'm going to say no

44:54 - because i don't know what you're talking about and i

45:01 - don't particularly believe i do anything abnormal

45:07 - from what i've seen from other kindred around i pretty much do the same things so i'll say no

45:14 - i can't do whatever it is you're referring to she seems relieved

45:21 - then why are you here because your boss called me here

45:26 - does your codery know what you are my codery knows very little about anything

45:32 - if they are in fact my codery well if you weren't before you are now it would seem so

45:40 - well now that we've cleared that up you have no reason to be uncomfortable anymore

45:46 - she tries to sink into the bar behind her unsuccessfully

45:52 - i see you and i see you i'll be watching

45:59 - please do and have a good evening and i'll take my leave and go

46:06 - with the purpose of finding uh fuego and rey knowing that seraph will catch up to me at some point

46:12 - very well i'm gonna wait until she you know turns away and then i'm gonna

46:19 - she turns her attention back to the dance floor gazing out uncomfortably over the

46:25 - sea faces and moving bodies so at this point i'm also making my way

46:30 - back up the stairs back up the stairs and out onto the dance floor yep okay that's so fun

46:36 - thank you for letting me do that you're welcome what did you think about what she said

46:43 - i think she's very old and a little confused

46:49 - but i'm curious about what she thinks you can do that you don't think you can yeah i guess we'll see yeah if anything

46:57 - happens in the future i don't think she's confused i think she sees the

47:03 - world differently and isn't unsure how to

47:11 - communicate it yeah she doesn't seem to have quite the way with words

47:16 - no but we should find the others and we should go talk to consuela to finish this

47:23 - evening's events i like that idea

47:29 - ray eventually you spot your associates

47:36 - on the dance floor sheriff and isaac okay

47:42 - mike bent way over to them ah where'd you slink off to nothing i was just uh

47:51 - no we'll talk about it later do we know where we're dropping off this uh uh our uh

47:58 - gift i think till richter yes we found consuela which would be our point of contact in this situation i believe

48:04 - great let's uh let's go do that well where's lego yeah fuego

48:11 - i'm going to leave your companion uh you sacked out on the couch yeah for sure she wasn't with us for very long you're

48:17 - returning to the club yes okay in that case i think it's very

48:22 - convenient that you should meet somewhere near the dance floor together huh oh yeah thank you

48:30 - so good thank you for asking you're so welcome oh my god shy practice like is that their name

48:37 - yeah yeah that was so look and i'll have to bore you with

48:44 - hey how's it going pretty good oh glowing almost oh my god thank you you're so welcome

48:50 - oh consuela right oh yeah back at the bar i checked my purse is the hand still in

48:55 - there it's definitely still in there the uh the hand in the plastic bag okay

49:01 - consuela has finished her conversation with the bartender is now perched on a

49:07 - stool at the bar itself she's got a glass of what might be wine in her hand

49:13 - that she's not drinking and she's looking out a provingly crossed

49:20 - the sea of people but she notices you when you approach and she raises your glass in

49:25 - your general direction you run quite the establishment consuela you should be so proud of yourself cue thank you

49:32 - if i do say i'm so myself it's a final place we got the thing

49:38 - you got it congratulations you know i have my doubts i wasn't sure you doubted us consuela

49:45 - well us maybe i doubted some of you

49:53 - that's fair we are here to return and the information and items that were

49:58 - requested did he pay up uh sort of sort of

50:05 - yes do we want it here we people can do you have it with you yeah of course i'll

50:10 - take it now richter's a little busy there's some

50:15 - there's a lot of political fallout tonight it's not every day somebody you know

50:20 - bites it for eternity i have a tiny teensy teeny tiny teensy little question

50:26 - um some of my friends and i were thinking about doing a little custom job on the cement pillars over there do you

50:32 - think if it was really nice looking director would maybe be cool with it

50:39 - you gonna tag his club i think of it more as an installation

50:44 - it could be very attractive could bring some you know some some little people

50:49 - more people get interested in the uh the location could be an investment free of charge obviously and you know

50:56 - what if richter is looking for an opportunity to uh

51:02 - sell some art again he's gonna need to drum up uh attention on

51:09 - maybe we found our new artist are you still sore about that killer

51:14 - if he wants his money back we could always do it again tempting

51:20 - [Music] you know technically my club in a way in a manner of speaking so it's

51:28 - probably my decision it sounds like you really want this i really do

51:34 - well then i have a favor to ask you okay

51:40 - what is it so i'll take the hand oh yeah here you go

51:48 - it's still wrapped up tightly in the plastic she looks inside

51:53 - i can't believe he did it wait did he do it he did the cut yeah

51:58 - it's clean right that's impressive well i wasn't going to do it himself it

52:04 - takes a certain measure of resolve to want to cut off an uh piece of your own body and i don't believe he had it well

52:10 - i wouldn't know well she tucks it under her arm okay

52:16 - i'll make sure the boss gets this i'll put in a good word he's gonna want to see you later

52:22 - i think bronx cheer will be going on soon you should stick around for the show at least for the for the first set

52:27 - maybe okay and then uh after you've settled up

52:32 - we'll talk i like this yeah we'll see okay yeah

52:39 - you get that that's how it works right favors for favors i think so yeah friends for friends

52:45 - i can see we're going to be besties i'd like to be besties with interesting people

52:50 - so do i good taste thank you mostly

52:55 - oh you know he's growing on me well we'll see

53:01 - he holds the door open for people how polite yeah well you gotta have one good trait

53:08 - right did you learn anything on your little adventure

53:13 - yeah i learned that uh a single fracture will make someone scream but a compound fracture

53:19 - they don't oh i like you better than i thought i did see he warms up to you

53:26 - well we'll see i better get this to the boss thank you enjoy yourselves you have the run of the

53:31 - place on stage backstage under stage whatever just not the office where should i go if

53:37 - i'm needing food she uh swirls the wine that she's not

53:44 - drinking around in her glass a little bit and makes a big show of sniffing it

53:49 - you mean if you're hungry if you need a little refreshment yes i don't want to well i mean look outside

53:56 - it's a big place i'm sure you can work it out but if you're picky or if you're shy

54:04 - not with an e i saw who you left the floor i just want to make sure

54:10 - i'm not feeding on anyone i'm not supposed to oh yeah that's important good idea right margo what i

54:18 - not again i learned nothing

54:23 - i recommend downstairs thank you i'll go downstairs too

54:30 - she hops off the stool and uh moves away with a determined pace

54:37 - clutching the grizzly trophy in the plastic bag in tune she's swallowed up by the people

54:45 - well downstairs you were just down there what's down there i mean i know what we saw on our tour

54:51 - but it took a little bit of the grand tour it's the uh you know the colosseum

54:57 - the fight club still under construction um

55:02 - found a couple back entrances that might be useful in the future

55:08 - uh but for the most part uh i don't know came back up here to check on you guys

55:13 - well well you missed us it appeared all right let's not look at it that way

55:18 - it appears that if one wants to feed uh downstairs is the place so

55:25 - there's more down there than you saw yeah i do know where there's a ham sandwich with about eight pints attached

55:31 - to it but other than that yeah maybe not there's side rooms too if you need like

55:36 - privacy right be careful

55:42 - don't get yourself into the same trouble again only new mistake it did bring us together though yeah

55:49 - also um never mind oh never mind let's go okay a wave of

55:55 - excitement ripples through the crowd bronx cheers taking the stage

56:01 - it's a trio a tall woman with beautifully angular

56:08 - features and gorgeous dark skin and the most luxurious long black hair that you have

56:14 - ever seen playing league guitar she's joined by a

56:19 - slender short spiky-haired person with a electric green coloration to their

56:25 - follicles on the drums wearing a t-shirt that says eat the rich

56:32 - and then an athletic young man with his hair shaved down to the stubble

56:39 - baggy clothes so oversized that you really can't tell much except broad shoulders and tall

56:46 - he's playing bass guitar it's hard to categorize their sound

56:53 - it's part hip hop part noise pop part punk it's completely unique and

57:00 - distinctive but it's good and people are into it they are reacting as their tastes and impulses

57:07 - take them some dance some sway some shout some just start immediately making out against the walls

57:13 - [Music] the dance cage begins swaying back and forth even more alarmingly

57:19 - [Applause] like a ship tossed at sea cannot be up the color it can't be it but i do want

57:25 - to get in there desperately i know music beats

57:30 - hard against your bodies as you push through the people on the dance floor

57:36 - feels almost like sound not blood

57:41 - is animating your body and that insistent rhythm makes you more aware of

57:46 - your insides than at any point since you became vampires

57:53 - there's something appealing and seductive about it right there here you're just one more body in the crowd

57:59 - and in the semi-darkness nobody notices or cares if you breathe or not

58:05 - and you wonder if maybe this is what eternal life should mean the freedom to dance

58:11 - to party to drink to love all night

58:18 - forever this seems like a good place

58:24 - to pause our vampire story for just a few moments

58:46 - hey everyone i'm yev i hear from new york city now uh victor sent me out here to do some tech work for a friend of his

58:53 - i haven't quite met up with them yet but uh but either way very exciting to be sent on location now back to the blazing

58:59 - uh big apple as they call it lots of fun things about the uh the big apple uh it's got it's got apples uh they're huge

59:07 - uh the nice thing about it is i tend to retain my memory out here back on the west coast uh

59:12 - i would lose entire days uh which was super strange and very weird

59:18 - but victor never seemed to be bothered by that in my memory lapses so that was good it didn't affect my employment

59:24 - which is great i love everything about it uh i guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the big apple uh i'm

59:31 - helping some of his friends or at least i'm supposed to be hopefully soon when they reach out but

1:15:05 - i don't know what else is uh what else is down here a couple other doors all those brick

1:15:10 - quarters and disused hallways a lot of rooms left over from the

1:15:15 - factory days filled with machinery and tools and a lot of dried brittle broken

1:15:22 - concrete everywhere it was a cement factory after all at one point in time a couple of those big portable cement

1:15:28 - mixers like they turned into the spotlights upstairs of course

1:15:34 - you know where the tanning salon is and it's chair and it's skylight although it's not

1:15:40 - exactly open for business right now i don't know have you checked

1:15:53 - and go see yeah i mean it's not really the end of our business and it might uh

1:15:59 - cause some ill will if we barge in on something we're not supposed to be doing i go back to the door to the door i'd

1:16:05 - like to put my ear next to the door so you make your way to the tanning salon

1:16:11 - it's a giant metal door

1:30:07 - you pass the second floor you can see through the open door on the landing that it's actually a big wide balcony that runs around the

1:30:13 - edge of the dance floor a lot of people up here hanging out drinking talking dancing looking down

1:30:19 - this is apparently where you get to that cage thing and then all the way up to the top floor

1:30:28 - to that meeting room long dark big windows on one side looking out over

1:30:35 - the river seeing the lights of queens from here rikers island

1:30:42 - richter is standing this time at the end of the tear

1:30:48 - and the table is strewn with papers and file folders

1:30:54 - maps genuine paper maps

1:31:04 - come on of course good evening

1:31:10 - hey good evening well

1:31:23 - he uh gestures at the floor by his feet where the plastic bag is sitting

1:31:28 - your work i hear yes clean isn't it nicely done

1:31:35 - so what's the story what was his hold up

1:31:41 - well it appears he attracted the attention

1:31:47 - of other people that were also demanding of his time and money and were

1:31:56 - causing him to be rooted to the spot

1:32:01 - people people uh some people people but under the

1:32:08 - employee of a us person

1:32:14 - larissa put nesca ah the [ __ ] putin asker really yeah

1:32:19 - oh i really need this that was uh are we gonna should we uh

1:32:25 - yeah you should there was one other name that got mentioned look we're not trying to we're not

1:32:30 - trying to give you bad news on a busy day yeah there's a good chance that cat

1:32:36 - costello's rent tonight was actually wrecked as ren or not richter sorry drexler's rent yeah

1:32:44 - cat costello is mixed up in this 100 her name was mentioned

1:32:52 - the hakata are beyond weird right so who knows

1:32:57 - maybe maybe not but i would like to know what the [ __ ] putin eska want

1:33:05 - seemed like drexler also owed them rent

1:33:11 - owed them money and what for what do you say why nope they say why no he kind of

1:33:16 - broke some dudes um real bad so he that was very nice yeah

1:33:21 - a guy passed out he might have known something i don't know we can talk it to him another time

1:33:27 - so you tortured a guy and got no information that was useful yeah i'm not very effective when when it comes to torture it's all airbox can do not to

1:33:34 - laugh when you say that he actually has to bite his lip i'm told it requires patience

1:33:42 - airbox looks at richter and richter says no no no no no not now well

1:33:48 - so you don't know why he was in debt to the putin asca no and

1:33:55 - you don't really know what the connection to cat costello is no i'm not about her making it right

1:34:01 - look drexler knew we worked for you did you want us to pry we know it's a busy night and maybe you don't want a bunch

1:34:07 - of heat on you from other people oh you're good let's just say i wanted to see what you

1:34:13 - would do as a as i mentioned

1:34:19 - any gestures to the stuff on the table i'm a busy guy

1:34:25 - as you uh look at the papers they're all spread out a lot of them look like financial reports

1:34:32 - a lot of columns that have a lot of figures in them right the map has various neighborhoods in the

1:34:39 - bronx circled different colors

1:34:44 - so callahan's dead i told you now let's have a moment of silence okay

1:34:49 - that was great um nobody liked that guy keep hearing this but uh

1:34:55 - things are moving fast already you ever hear of a nickname torque no

1:35:00 - stupid neighbor stupid stupid name oh stupid stupid name

1:35:05 - yeah he's uh his digs are up in belmont north in the borough

1:35:11 - he and his coterie are kind of big shots around here he's decided he's the new baron all of a

1:35:18 - sudden didn't waste any time i mean ashes aren't even cold yet wasn't there

1:35:23 - supposed to be a vote or something yeah well

1:35:30 - you're gonna find out that the anarch movement at least around here

1:35:36 - is less movement more of a kind of free-for-all

1:35:42 - whatever you can do is yours

1:35:47 - so nah no vote what was callaghan's territory like i mean

1:35:53 - he likes to hang out in staten island which tells you everything you've gotten to know about him right because you know

1:35:59 - right everything you gotta know so but you know he was no slouch either i

1:36:05 - don't know how he got taken out it had to be somebody pretty beefy i mean you've been around a while

1:36:12 - something like 1880s or something well he was really old-fashioned he was an absolute jerk

1:36:20 - i heard it said he used to run with the sabbat who knows that word lizzy

1:36:27 - flinches visibly and turns her

1:36:33 - stare on isaac and she points

1:36:39 - okay pointing is rude as [ __ ] busy we went over this yeah his name is isaac not sabot yeah

1:36:48 - lizzy something you want to tell the rest of the class

1:36:56 - he says he's not do you believe him

1:37:06 - hmm arya not to my knowledge

1:37:15 - i wasn't around for the big fight neither was i

1:37:20 - so you say i mean first it's la sombra

1:37:25 - and now you guys you heard about that now we got the sombra god i don't know what

1:37:31 - i don't know what prince p is thinking but whatever look all i know

1:37:37 - is that uh we're not common and apparently we make people

1:37:42 - uncomfortable i heard you ain't common in the ivory tower and you ain't common in the

1:37:49 - movement but there is a group you are common in a were or might be

1:37:55 - and that's the sabbat i keep hearing that word in the last five minutes and

1:38:00 - doesn't mean anything to me let me teach you people anything truly nothing i am holding so many questions yeah one

1:38:07 - what's the sabbat two what's the song bra yeah three who's prince p

1:38:14 - richter looks at air box air box shrugs i'm doing that a lot tonight i haven't

1:38:20 - uh i haven't got time to play nurse mate but i can't have you running around ignorant

1:38:29 - i'm gonna keep my word you paid your rent you took care of uh drexler for me so you're gonna get what

1:38:35 - i promised you gonna piece of dirt call your own

1:38:40 - territory like i said domain if you're fancy

1:38:49 - he looks at the map

1:38:54 - i haven't got time to deal with putin eska or cat costello or any of that so

1:39:02 - i'm going to give you port morris yeah now it's your problem i don't think

1:39:08 - drexler's your problem the putin eska is your problem cat costello if she's involved also your problem

1:39:15 - remember what i said keep your [ __ ] secret don't make it my issue you'll be fine but you would like to us

1:39:22 - to keep you informed of what's going on of course only if it's interesting great if i

1:39:27 - don't hear about it how interesting can it really be that's very very true yeah think you can handle

1:39:33 - it absolutely i think we can handle almost anything can i ask a question

1:39:39 - i think you're probably better since you don't seem to know the required curriculum i don't

1:39:46 - uh and i want to lean over the map and point at like my family's neighborhood like where my

1:39:52 - mom lives who's in charge of that area that's part of torque's piece

1:39:58 - interesting yeah he's all high-minded ideals

1:40:04 - he's been preaching revolution and rebellion against the camarilla for i don't know how long i get sick of

1:40:10 - listening to it but maybe now he'll actually do something

1:40:15 - if he's the new baron yeah we got barons we have barons and counts and who knows

1:40:20 - what else there's probably dukes and duchesses too for all i know you had another question who's prince p

1:40:27 - hm that's prince helene

1:40:32 - panhard i know right imagine having to get up every night

1:40:39 - look in the mirror and say i'm prince panhard

1:40:44 - yeah but she's no slouch either she's been around a while

1:40:50 - she's clan ventrue interesting

1:40:57 - most princes are a lot of barons too these

1:41:02 - nights huh yeah she's the uh i guess you could say the

1:41:09 - compromise candidate in the tower she's the only one nobody hated enough to do anything about

1:41:15 - so they made a prince hmm

1:41:21 - this was all after the sabbat war stuff oh yeah what's a sabbat and what's a la sombra oh my god i can take care of the

1:41:27 - lasaun for one of you you got this one covered i can do it later so i don't waste your time no i would love to hear

1:41:32 - it remember when i talked about other clans everywhere the sombra's another clan cool

1:41:38 - wow keeping things simple listen professor you can't leave her with just that i

1:41:44 - wasn't going to all right the lasombra are a clan that are very

1:41:49 - similar to ventrue in certain ways in that they tend to put themselves in positions of power but generally instead

1:41:55 - of venture doing business they'll sombra do religion and they deal with shadows

1:42:04 - if i'm to trust what i've heard interesting okay it's true

1:42:13 - thank you for your incredible input lizzie and there's a bot too

1:42:18 - what's that okay and we're not interested in sabbat what is it

1:42:24 - well the saboter uh i don't know how you would describe it i mean it's a

1:42:32 - it's the closest thing we got to a vampire death cult i guess oh they are

1:42:37 - bad news okay really really [ __ ] up vampires i mean

1:42:43 - you want no part of it and they hate the camarilla something fierce i guess

1:42:49 - i don't know i've never met one okay unless maybe i have i don't know

1:42:54 - okay we can stop looking at isaac now i feel like i'd be uh a lot more

1:42:59 - um better off if i was able to do that kind of thing

1:43:06 - i don't know don't know too much about it but the sombra and your clan

1:43:12 - i guess they're like tight with the sabato they used to be i don't know

1:43:17 - i wouldn't last couple of decades everything got all confused nothing's like it used to be

1:43:23 - well considering i've only been around for a couple of years i wouldn't know anything about that

1:43:29 - yeah you ain't smart enough to be older i think or you're a good actor i don't know which

1:43:35 - yeah yeah anyway

1:43:40 - the lasombra didn't want much to do with camarilla or the anarchs until really

1:43:48 - recently and then suddenly it's hey let us in we're not happy where we were could we come into your house and

1:43:54 - mess things up some princes are allowing it to happen i hear chicago

1:44:02 - is where it started but i ain't got the deets but here here in new york

1:44:08 - the prince has let a few in if you're unlucky you might meet one

1:44:15 - you never know i don't know

1:44:21 - tork can beat baron for all i care as long as he leaves my business alone

1:44:28 - if he wants to lord it over me well he can meet me in the pit when's the pit gonna be open

1:44:36 - next week should come everyone who's anyone's gonna be there

1:44:43 - second question do you need potentially any branding or uh custom

1:44:48 - artwork for the pit weird question talk to consuela i like

1:44:54 - that answer thank you consuela just nods and smiles at you

1:45:01 - yeah so so port morris port morrissey

1:45:06 - you got to take care of it now i would recommend spending some time get to know the place i haven't had a

1:45:13 - lot of uh time lately as you can see keep an eye on it

1:45:19 - feeding uh maybe not so great but maybe you can improve it

1:45:25 - i like a fixer-upper good thing although some of those real estate investment

1:45:32 - bankers might be beating you to it isaac is uh port morris where you're already

1:45:38 - residing yeah convenient huh yes yeah almost like this was planned from the beginning

1:45:44 - almost i mean couldn't know it would happen you might have died

1:45:51 - did you no that's a good point what happened to us

1:45:56 - well hard to know you're all young you don't know a lot

1:46:02 - and some of you have problems with your temper

1:46:07 - i don't know who we could be talking about me neither which brings me to

1:46:12 - the last item on the agenda airbox

1:46:18 - he moves so fast your eye can't really track him and he's in front of you and hitting you

1:46:25 - before you can move cool cool cool cool let's do some things with that you can

1:46:30 - take it or you can punch back uh i'm punching back

1:46:35 - i'm not even looking at a roll for that i'm punching back i'm going to roll a lot of dice

1:46:44 - he is hungry i am going to

1:46:50 - uh activate toughness if i can hmm it's toughness passive no it's active

1:46:58 - does it require a browser i believe it will require a route check yes you're talking about the uh

1:47:03 - level two fortitude mm-hmm double oh no sorry plus one round i believe it

1:47:10 - is your house check yes it is why don't you make check for that right now i'm gonna get a little bit hungrier

1:47:21 - rip his head off take him out sure as hell try to he's got a very

1:47:27 - thick neck though more blood for us

1:47:32 - go for it you ready yeah let's do it

1:47:42 - okay um

1:47:48 - six successes and what am i rolling against that uh you are rolling your

1:47:54 - strength and brawl if you're fighting back okay you get the impression he's holding back

1:48:00 - on you maybe he's trying to see what you've got it's not striking you with his

1:48:05 - full potential three successes three successes so the

1:48:11 - margin is three so you take three superficial reduce but they're cut in

1:48:16 - half and then reduced again for my for your toughness so even though you're buffeted by his

1:48:23 - fists rocked by the blows you take it and you're not damaged but

1:48:28 - you don't manage to hit him either at least not in any way that does need permanent harm yeah

1:48:35 - and then he really gets going

1:48:41 - serif isaac margot what what was i supposed to just

1:48:47 - sit here and let this happen i'd like to catch chemistry okay

1:48:53 - let's get intentions ray are you gonna continue to try to give as good as you get

1:49:00 - yeah no one hits me and doesn't get hit back okay margo i want to distract airbox distract

1:49:06 - him in what way what's the distraction uh i would try to use mesmerize on him trying to catch his eye in the middle of

1:49:12 - a fight really difficult to do so it's going to be very hard very difficult task serif

1:49:19 - i would like to try and create an illusion of um rey that's closer to margot's line of

1:49:26 - sight it's got to be a flickering instant moment right

1:49:32 - so maybe something he sees out of the corner of his eye or maybe he would think there's another attacker somehow that he

1:49:39 - failed to notice yes okay isaac i stand and keep looking at richter

1:49:45 - richter's watching he doesn't seem too emotionally involved in the altercation

1:49:52 - consuela does though she's watching with wrapped attention she's digging this

1:49:57 - lizzy though is watching isaac

1:50:03 - okay so from this side first

1:50:08 - go ahead and make that shimmer street roll serif at the same time and

1:50:15 - why dominate in the middle of combat not an easy thing to do especially when you are not the individual

1:50:22 - being hit in the line of sight it's manipulation and dominate and it does require a rouse check

1:50:30 - so if you've got a rouse check coming make one now yeah did it so you are not getting hungry

1:50:36 - failure failure that's why i get hungry um so stepping in

1:50:42 - where you aren't wanted well as long as you're going to do it

1:50:47 - give them one for me i'll do my best

1:50:52 - okay so how many successes on the roll oh [ __ ]

1:50:59 - four worst successes good not good enough

1:51:05 - so to an office skate what else am i rolling you are rolling one moment here

1:51:15 - i'm on the wrong page you're rolling uh manipulation and

1:51:20 - obfuscate okay

1:51:27 - two successes two successes well let's see his

1:51:32 - pool he's unprepared for it he doesn't have any idea what you're doing

1:51:39 - okay not great so and the punching of rey

1:51:45 - you're gonna roll your uh your retaliation strengthen brawl again once more time

1:51:52 - okay two successes two successes yeah

1:51:58 - okay he's got a messy critical yeah let's do it okay

1:52:04 - certain things happen at once yeah i can burn a willpower but it's not even going to do anything against that the margin is too wide unfortunately but

1:52:11 - that wouldn't stop well uh that wouldn't stop right trying okay uh

1:52:17 - superficial willpower damage you re-roll it yep still nothing still nothing okay

1:52:24 - margo you attempt to lock eyes with air box but he is so intent on

1:52:31 - beating ray to a pulp that you can't get his attention long enough

1:52:36 - for the whammy to take hold but something else happens

1:52:42 - serif you create a flickering illusion a momentary shadow perhaps

1:52:49 - out of the corner of airbox's eye and he got the messi critical

1:52:54 - but he also takes his attention off ray just for a moment to look in surprise to his left and maybe that explains what

1:53:01 - happens next instead of punching you

1:53:07 - punching through you he shoves out through the window

1:53:14 - you hear the sound shattering glass and you don't do that hanging in suspended air

1:53:20 - thing like in the cartoons you plummet straight down to the parking lot it's three stories

1:53:27 - it's a superficial point of damage for every three meters or so so

1:53:33 - it's 12 points of superficial damage cut in half okay and then minus your toughness which leaves you with

1:53:41 - my toughness is two but that is for taking down um yes so that would leave me with four

1:53:50 - so your health track is almost filled up no you've got a little left right let's

1:53:56 - see here i am normally at five so you filled four boxes with superficial damage

1:54:04 - one more and you're trackable filled and you'll be impaired you land with a sickening crunch

1:54:10 - fortunately it didn't hit anybody's car that hurt

1:54:15 - you can hear and feel bones moved where they're not supposed to be

1:54:21 - you think maybe you fractured your wrist you're just staring up at the night sky and the broken window

1:54:28 - three stories above you if you didn't have toughness

1:54:34 - you'd be on the uh road to torpor yeah hey man are you okay

1:54:39 - holy crap i can't believe you're alive oh yeah call an ambulance i'm just gonna

1:54:47 - back into this [Music] there's no reception here though go that

1:54:54 - way you're gonna have to now it hurts yeah we need to we need to yeah we need to with the cage

1:55:01 - he gives an address you start shouting takes his attention off of you and as

1:55:06 - soon as he is i'm gonna start moving to away pick yourself up yep your suit is ruined absolutely ruined

1:55:15 - are you attempting to leave this vicinity before he at least get around a corner or something like that

1:55:21 - now margo mesmerism

1:55:28 - didn't work out so well but something else happens

1:55:33 - something stirs in your heart

1:55:38 - and in your blood and your mouth is filled with that cinnamony paprika-y

1:55:45 - red pepper taste that you recall when you drank shy earlier this evening

1:55:51 - and without intending to without conscious thought

1:55:59 - suddenly all that star magnetism that you're able

1:56:04 - to bring to bear when you want to practically glows

1:56:10 - from your body you become the most riveting creature on

1:56:15 - the planet for just a moment long enough

1:56:21 - for richter to put his attention completely on you

1:56:29 - hey he was bored with this as i am

1:56:35 - terribly i remember you said you uh like to dance

1:56:40 - yeah all right always with partner let's go have a talk okay and a little dance

1:56:47 - consuela looks like she is going to come over the table at you

1:56:55 - fingers curl into fists and she looks like she's going to start

1:57:01 - something but she thinks better of it

1:57:09 - and she just watches you leave with him i happily like loop my arm in his and

1:57:14 - blow our little kisses i leave the room

1:57:20 - he's friendly he's attentive he isn't particularly affectionate at

1:57:26 - least not yet but the night's not over

1:57:35 - lizzie hasn't stopped looking at you for a moment

1:57:41 - well i look at consuela are we allowed to leave

1:57:51 - she's just staring after margot and richter she nods

1:57:56 - we should go okay lizzy holds out her hand

1:58:03 - just a moment yeah she pulls her hair

1:58:09 - away from her eyes so that she can see her full face for the first time

1:58:14 - and she looks at you intently

1:58:24 - let's see how hungry is she

1:58:42 - i see you when she says this her eyes are closed

1:58:49 - and they see you too i believe you now

1:58:58 - you are not one of them

1:59:04 - but they might be one of you hmm

1:59:16 - hello good night good night

1:59:22 - uh consuela we will confer about that piece perhaps you touch one rusted paint

1:59:30 - fleck on this building and i'll put you in that chair downstairs

1:59:36 - okay it will not happen

1:59:41 - we should yeah

1:59:51 - richter and margo

1:59:59 - he escorts you to the cage

2:00:04 - it's not easy to keep your balance in there but it's a lot of fun it's a raw

2:00:13 - visceral experience swaying high above the crowd knowing that if these chains break

2:00:21 - you're going down you're gonna crush the people below you it's part of the fun

2:00:28 - richter is a surprisingly good dancer but he climbs on

2:00:33 - the cage uses his unnatural strength

2:00:40 - to move around it in ways that he probably shouldn't

2:00:46 - the crowd is really into it and they're into you and him together

2:00:52 - below you bronx cheers finishing their set crowd is going absolutely wild in approval

2:01:01 - richter smiles at you good time the best

2:01:08 - and i'm gonna try to kiss him you're gonna go in for the kiss he's not gonna stop you

2:01:16 - he'll return it he's a good kisser maybe a little out of practice

2:01:25 - the night's still young the night is still young so we leave you

2:01:30 - swaying above the crowd the music crescendoing below you the kiss

2:01:36 - taking on an unlife all its own

2:01:43 - the rest of you making your way out or staying around for margo

2:01:51 - i'll stick around i'll go find rey

2:02:01 - when you find him oh ah you're still with us yeah

2:02:10 - how did they do they're fine yeah good do they pass the test

2:02:26 - so i think things are fine good can you walk

2:02:32 - slowly at first but yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll be fine great

2:02:39 - you can see that at the entrance of the parking lot there are a couple emergency vehicles approaching

2:02:46 - police car it's lights flashing and followed by an ambulance probably for you

2:02:53 - i'll drop the jacket here just so i look a little different especially because that took

2:02:59 - a lot of the damage as well uh and then we'll walk around

2:03:05 - is there like a smoking patio or something like that everybody's smoking everywhere around here

2:03:12 - okay i'll um i'll just kind of see if i can just

2:05:38 - with margo enjoying the last of the evening swaying above the crowd

2:05:44 - with richter serif keeping a careful eye on her associate and drinking in every detail
