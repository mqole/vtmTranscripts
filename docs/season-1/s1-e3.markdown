1:09 - color thank you to dogmite games for our beautiful storyteller
1:15 - screen and dice boxes for each of our characters and thank you to renegade game studios
1:22 - for making sure we never run out of dice and books
1:31 - as prologue let's think about this for a minute
1:36 - let's think about what the city is in our story it's the place where everything happens
1:43 - obviously it's the visual textual and sensual palette
1:51 - that holds all the colors that the characters experience it's a representation of our themes
1:57 - a body of moods and an atmosphere the city is a playground
2:05 - for some vampires and prison to others it's the
2:10 - chain-link wilderness and the concrete ruins where the kindred explore and hunt
2:16 - and it's a character that insinuates itself into every scene that we share with you it's
2:22 - a character that speaks with a million different voices a character with a face of steel and
2:28 - brackish water stone concrete
2:34 - and a character with a body of asphalt and pipe it's the embodiment of long history
2:42 - home to millions backgrounds to their lives the satellite image that we see on
2:48 - screen on the green street lights on the corner the midnight lights of that untouchable
2:55 - skyline and a cracked asphalt that runs with blood
3:03 - with this firmly in mind let's tell a vampire story
3:11 - [Music]
3:18 - [Music]
3:57 - [Music]
4:09 - [Music]
4:23 - [Music]
4:34 - it is several nights later and you kindred
4:39 - find yourselves standing before a dilapidated old brownstone building
4:44 - one of the few still standing in the neighborhood of port morris that
4:50 - mostly industrial mixed use area of the south bronx now you are a little familiar with this
4:55 - area by now because only a few nights ago this neighborhood is where you got into it
5:01 - with some mortal thugs who are roughing up your friend enemy frenemy
5:07 - drexler a local kindred and this adventure was part of paying your rent or paying off richter
5:14 - the vampire crime boss who is now your landlord because port morris this neighborhood
5:21 - is now your territory yours to claim yours to hunt
5:27 - to build to save or to destroy
5:34 - you don't know that much about it yet to begin your exploration of your new
5:41 - domain you've agreed to accept an invitation to meet at this building
5:47 - an invitation from isaac he's implied that this is the place
5:53 - where he sleeps it's located along the riverfront
5:58 - it's a part of a neighborhood that gives him a nighttime view of the east river and north brother island
6:05 - a short walk from the curious resting old and famous gantry bridges
6:10 - that still loom over part of the river shore and from here you can see
6:16 - the unfinished towers of the crescent which is a luxury condominium
6:22 - that big money real estate investors are building just over the expressway
6:27 - they must be on a tight deadline because you can see the construction cranes are operating even now after dark
6:38 - let's take care of some housekeeping it's been a very busy couple of nights
6:45 - many of you have spent willpower or willfully damaged your willpower
6:51 - so if you have voluntarily taken willpower damage for re-rolls or to control
6:59 - yourself hmm let's see
7:04 - regain a number of those points equal to your composure or your resolve whichever
7:10 - is higher that should bring your willpower back up to full
7:17 - for most of you actually all of you i think now
7:24 - several of you have wounds but i think everyone is
7:30 - healed because serif you took care of that bullet and we'll get back to that in a moment
7:36 - but ray you took some damage from a little fall well little tumble yeah just
7:41 - a little fall out a three-story window you took four points of superficial damage
7:48 - so as you know you can mend one point of circuit official damage for
7:54 - every rouse check that you make so you could heal it all in one go but risk a lot of hunger or we can spread it out
8:01 - over a couple of nights start rolling and see where we get let's
8:07 - see where we get
8:12 - let me roll that one again that was in the corner no good failure yep still heals one wound level
8:20 - okay but it puts you at two hunger puts me at three hundred
8:26 - you had two to carry over so now you're at three
8:31 - shall we say that you hunt in between you're mending
8:38 - or do you want it yeah yeah i'd say
8:43 - push it to the edge let's let's see what happens with one more roll yeah let's give it a try
8:52 - success that's two wounds out of four that you've mended
8:59 - and we have two nights so i think this would be the night to go out on a bit of a hunt
9:05 - and save the other two for the next night i think that sounds like an excellent
9:10 - idea unless you want to risk getting to hunger five
9:16 - you don't no i can at least do that math
9:21 - you're an alley cat you like to overpower your prey you like the struggle
9:27 - you like it when they fight back all right let's do this let's make um
9:33 - i'll leave it up to you you can make a strength and brawl roll that's a good pool for you or you can make it wits and
9:39 - street wise
9:44 - i think i'm going to go with wits and streetwise because that's a little bit higher for me
9:55 - three successes three successes the important question of the moment
10:03 - do you kill your prey
10:08 - but i would like to know if in my searches through the alleys
10:15 - i found a smoker someone who enjoys a cigarette or a cigar even better yeah
10:22 - someone who just ducked into an alley to smoke while
10:27 - maybe having dinner with friends or something like that someone who politely excused themselves from society
10:34 - for a moment to take care of an affliction yes and it was their good manners that brought them
10:40 - across your path so you state your hunger on this individual the nicotine
10:48 - adding a little zing to your vitae is very satisfying
10:57 - shall we take care of those other wounds or do you want to just let it ride for now
11:04 - as you savor the taste of the nicotine laced blood let's see if we can take care of at
11:10 - least one more let's try
11:15 - success ah it's satisfying too to feel the bones
11:22 - knit together the sinews reattach themselves to where they're supposed to be in the joints to
11:28 - work properly again so i think it's worth going with the streak
11:35 - go one more fail
11:41 - so oops put you at two yeah okay now one more roll to make
11:47 - and that's the rouse check for when you rose this evening
11:54 - fail so there are always always downsides
12:03 - being a member of the undead is largely in existence of risk management
12:10 - you've managed to knit all your wounds back together you're hail and hearty again but
12:16 - the consequence is being much more hungry
12:22 - now then margo when last we left you
12:30 - you were seen dancing in a cage with none other than richter himself
12:38 - the question i think on everyone's minds is how did the night end
12:46 - i think uh margot made an entire meal out of telling serif the
12:53 - extremely graphic details of how that night ended
12:59 - no and then he was down and i was up on the cage and then
13:04 - then he was up on the cage and i was on the bottom and then and then after that yeah everyone left
13:11 - and then it was just the two and then it was just the two of us and that was for a couple more hours and
13:16 - then i think it was close to dawn because he was looking a little maybe that was
13:22 - it might have been me anyway he got tired so i took off yeah i'm sorry i couldn't
13:28 - stay longer that ambulance really waked me up yeah no worries you don't want to have seen what that turned into maybe i
13:35 - did i don't know i wasn't there no judge i wasn't there no judgment you know who was there the entire time though bronx
13:42 - cheer kept playing saw them looking up kind of into that that's the new thing i've learned about
13:48 - myself i'm so happy for you thank you you're so welcome oh my god
13:53 - so that
13:59 - serif yes about that tagging
14:07 - i need to do something i gotta do something
14:13 - did it happen anyway is it going to happen anyway
14:19 - it didn't happen that night but who's to say
14:24 - what happens tonight well i think your three friends
14:30 - who were really into the project might still be into it
14:36 - okay that's for you to decide
14:41 - so margo and serif please make a rouse check to see if you got hungry this evening
14:48 - fail success fail success so you don't you stay at your former hunger
14:54 - but
14:59 - fuego darling i'm so proud of you
15:05 - for once you sought power
15:12 - you brought power to you you seduced power that is our way
15:21 - more of that please whatever you want make me proud of you
15:29 - okay and finally isaac
15:35 - yes how hungry are you uh i come succeeded in my routes check
15:40 - so i'm at one gain no additional hunger nope
15:46 - as your guests stand before your door any special preparations that you've
15:52 - made no no special preparations um
15:59 - am i with them or am i inside i would presume that you were inside awaiting their arrival but i'll leave
16:05 - that up to you no i'm inside waiting their arrival no special preparations but i will have some
16:12 - explanations and rules once they're inside and what about your
16:18 - two compatriots michael and angela are they on the parenthesis yeah they're in the house
16:24 - michael has promised to have a report for you about the contents of the briefcase
16:31 - by the time your guests arrive tonight great
16:36 - so serif margot and ray you've arrived
16:42 - this is it wow okay okay i don't know what i was
16:48 - expecting but i this is really nice i feel like we were
16:54 - just here isn't drexler's like yeah oh yeah it's like right around the corner that way yeah yeah
16:59 - yeah it's it's quite close a couple of blocks at the most it does explain how his people got here there so quickly
17:06 - that's a really fair point okay that does make sense don't know if drexler's there or not
17:12 - tonight you can always check that's how i want to see how his hand's doing or maybe later do you know how long it
17:18 - takes to like regrow a limb no idea dude i'm curious yeah i don't know we could go find out
17:24 - do you care i feel like he might owe us a little bit
17:30 - we were kind of nice to him and for the kind of trouble you get in
17:35 - you might want to know how gross yeah yeah yeah i could uh
17:43 - pick his brain about that okay maybe later though yeah sure let's go

18:21 - um you see a very uh
18:30 - run down interior it looks like it was once
18:37 - nice but it has since fallen into disrepair and things and it doesn't look like

19:01 - the house edward scissorhands lives in ah okay a little with a little less

20:06 - of course other than that i'll give you the tour and i take them
20:12 - through and the first floor is uh really as i said full of things covered in tarps and looks like stored there's a lot of
20:21 - art pieces and sculptures and things like that and trinkets and knickknacks and
20:27 - looks like things that have been collected over a long time is it good art some of it is and some of it isn't um it
20:33 - is looks like a lot of the um less good is down here on the first
20:40 - floor i take them around there is a very um there is a restroom off to the left-hand
20:46 - side that is not used um there is a uh it's just a pretty open space on this
20:53 - first floor there's a couple of rooms there is a kitchen there is you know normal stuff down there and then i take
20:58 - them up to the second floor which is a little nicer seeing is there is
21:04 - some people do live on this floor it's been a little cleaned um there is still dust on the
21:09 - windowsills and everything looks like isaac doesn't particularly care whether or not something is dusty
21:15 - up here there are more there's more uh art and things looks like a little bit of nicer pieces and they and um some
21:21 - stuff but still dusty and then there is the third floor which he does not take you up
21:29 - so this is where i live um this is also

27:12 - well-heeled money
27:19 - there is a young man dressed as nice as rey is
27:25 - who has parked his car in the neighborhood it's a nice vehicle
27:32 - sports car new he is taking a look
27:38 - at the crescent the luxury condominiums that are rising up on the riverside now you're still
27:43 - several blocks away but maybe he's here for the vantage point and he's using his phone to
27:50 - take pictures of the rising scaffolding and steel and the concrete that the cranes are
27:55 - building he hears you as you approach and
28:01 - turns around a little startled but relaxes and uh hey can i help you

28:12 - from here no no no i live in brooklyn i'm
28:17 - a project here uh it's uh it's the crescent it's uh it's a new development
28:24 - uh i'm i'm involved in a minor way and i'm just
28:30 - making sure that things are happening the way they're supposed to if you get my meaning
28:36 - night work like this for cranes isn't exactly cleared with the borough board i don't know that they would appreciate
28:43 - it but interesting but i mean who cares right i mean this
28:49 - is going to be the best thing that ever happened to the neighborhood incredible
28:55 - i would like to use blush of life blush of life you must make a rouse check let's do it you must rouse your blood
29:03 - pass as a success yet hungrier
29:09 - but your body is suffused with the facsimile of a living existence
29:16 - um i'm so sorry and she like makes sure that like little goose pimples go across
29:21 - your skin she looks cold and a little scared i'm supposed to be meeting my friends
29:27 - uh right here there's some like underground club i think it's really yeah
29:33 - do you want to come with me awesome ah he makes a
29:39 - effort to uh appear to think about it for a few minutes but
29:44 - yeah yeah i'm i'm totally in let me um oh we don't even we haven't even been i'm sean oh hi margo margo hey
29:53 - how you doing um wow uh cool you know you don't get in invited uh to an underground uh club in
29:59 - the bronx but a cool stranger very often well i feel lucky it's just legal
30:04 - what wait are you a cop are you oh my god no
30:11 - i had you i had you okay uh my friends all tell me i'm a funny guy oh my god you're so
30:17 - funny and cute and like move some of his hair like away like come on let's go let's get the [ __ ] out
30:25 - of here ah he takes your arm and his and where are we going where's the club um okay according to my phone uh it's like
30:32 - two blocks that way okay can we go let's cut through this alley sure i just want to be off of these streets oh yeah i
30:38 - don't blame you i i don't see anybody so let's do it yeah okay yeah hey oh watch out for the crack the garbage oh my god
30:45 - yeah i know they should empty these dumpsters more often thank you and i definitely cling onto his arm more and
30:50 - like lead him very quickly down the alley ray your prey is approaching
30:56 - uh it's a very dark alley um but you know silhouetted
31:02 - on either ends so as long as you're against a wall or something like that it's difficult to see you in there
31:07 - especially if you're partially concealed by one of those overflowing dumpsters i'm going to activate eyes of the beast just so i can make sure that i can see
31:14 - them coming by keeping in mind to make sure that it's
31:20 - not uh you know glowing too much and you can't control the intensity of it
31:25 - it's just the occasional glance up every now and then rather than staring them down perhaps and
31:33 - glance can't promise you won't notice but
31:38 - once they're within arm's reach what happens unceremoniously just
31:44 - grab him and take a bite from the back of the neck are you using any of your
31:50 - supernatural gifts or are you relying on your own
31:55 - strength and abilities what would apply here well i
32:00 - you could can i use lethal body to hold him without a full body increases the amount of the kind of damage that you do
32:08 - if you wanted to be sure he doesn't get away and take no risks then you could of course
32:16 - risk greater hunger to increase your physical abilities
32:23 - but you're already at three it seems like it seems like the right
32:28 - way to make sure though make a rouse check and that's a success
32:34 - you do not get hungrier but you feel the power
32:40 - flow through your undead limbs and you strike you pounce
32:47 - he doesn't know you're there this is a complete surprise please make a strength and brawl roll
32:54 - and add two extra dice for your
33:00 - surge supernatural power six successes six successes
33:09 - he doesn't even have time to shout before you're on him your arm around his throat the other pulling down
33:16 - his shoulder sinking your fangs into
33:22 - his neck and i will take off two points of hunger two out of three love to lean in while
33:29 - he's feeding and say can you kill him for me
33:36 - please
33:41 - we're getting here already huh okay i am going to take off three points of hunger
33:51 - the only way to be full to be warm is to take
33:58 - your prey out of this world so you take away one two
34:03 - three hunger dice take everything he has to give
34:11 - and his lifeless body cold getting colder by the second
34:17 - slips to the alley floor
34:24 - now thank you all right let's
34:31 - consider your personal convictions for a moment shall we
34:36 - let's just refresh our memory about what you believe
34:54 - um you believe very strongly
35:00 - in two things asking for help is the same as admitting defeat
35:07 - it doesn't seem to apply here except didn't you ask for help
35:16 - is that what you meant when you drew that line in the moral sand for yourself
35:23 - i'd call it a fine line to say that i asked if she could not said that i needed it
35:29 - a bit of a gray area how about your other conviction
35:35 - be a human not a beast that one seems to be in jeopardy a
35:41 - little hmm you haven't violated either of the chronicle tenants
35:47 - stand your ground or justice must be served in fact from margo's point of view
35:53 - justice might have been done here we'll talk about your conscience in a moment
35:59 - so be a human not a beast
36:11 - let's check your humanity let's see what your conscience says take four dice black dice no hunger dice
36:19 - and roll them
36:26 - two successes all you needed was one your conscience
36:32 - is stirred and you remember what you promised yourself if you remember the things you said you
36:39 - wouldn't do and yet you have done so
36:44 - you feel remorse but you don't sink any further down the humanity spiral tonight
36:51 - but the night's not over yet so we'll see margo
36:57 - you believe different things
37:04 - you believe in always protecting your family at any cost of course but you also believe you must protect
37:10 - the bronx from those who would destroy it yeah
37:15 - you also know that justice must be served because that's one of our chronicle tenets
37:21 - how did this man's death violate or serve your moral conscience
37:26 - look i see these people moving in
37:32 - chasing money they don't care about the people that live here
37:38 - but i do i'll remember them and i'll look out for them
37:46 - he was so excited to brag about flouting the bureau board's
37:52 - uh guidelines look me and mateo may not be in a great place right now but i still respect the
37:58 - work that he's doing that i used to be doing so i'll help how i can
38:05 - i agree i think that not only did you not violate your convictions you served them
38:15 - are you missing any willpower no well then
38:21 - i will make a note
38:30 - still going on to drexler's are you gonna go back no i think we can head back
38:36 - meanwhile at isaac's haven can i see the third floor no
38:41 - no please look
38:47 - i like rules i like very clear precise rules
38:52 - especially regarding my living space that's fair maybe someday
38:59 - no ah unless it is absolutely necessary for some unforeseen reason okay
39:06 - no okay okay but
39:12 - a room of your own if you like it hmm this place is big enough
39:20 - i wonder what they got i don't know he
39:25 - um is difficult yeah he is going to get into a lot of trouble
39:31 - i think you have to learn to accept that just because someone thinks
39:37 - they're better than you doesn't mean they are and you have to be the one to let that go sometime
39:44 - i couldn't agree more and he will find himself to be in quite many
39:52 - situations like this if he continues to argue all the time how do you have such
39:58 - good self-control i'm
40:03 - always been this way even before even before hmm there isn't a reason to get upset
40:13 - if the long-term effects of what's happening to you
40:20 - don't matter if you will still have everything you have
40:25 - and everything you need then what's the problem
40:33 - it serves me well in my life and line of work and
40:38 - well now my death so nothing much changed other than
40:44 - ordering dinner is a lot more simple than it was before i walk over to some of the art and i start
40:51 - rifling through it pictures paintings illustrations
40:56 - charcoal sculptures some of these yours
41:01 - some which ones um
41:08 - most aren't down here um that one's mine and he points to a sculpture
41:15 - um i have a little bit of uh training i
41:21 - but only sculpture i don't do anything else um it is a
41:27 - sort of a this large black
41:33 - circle that is built in such a way that it looks like you should be able to
41:40 - see through it but it is almost as though it is a hole that
41:45 - leads into straight black it's um
41:54 - when i'm bored and don't have anything to do i mess around um i like it thank you
42:02 - i did think about doing that once when i was younger but
42:08 - other things came up and took a different path so it um
42:16 - yeah i just do it for fun now i know the feeling
42:22 - what where are you from places
42:29 - who made you someone
42:35 - who taught me things about art
42:42 - thanks which is why you now uh
42:48 - went out on your own to do the art that they don't approve of
42:54 - yeah make sense
43:00 - i just get the feeling you are very astute observer of people
43:08 - i didn't i didn't finish school i didn't wasn't there for long
43:14 - but i did spend a lot of time around people and knowing people keeps you
43:20 - well i may not be the best example but keeps you alive
43:26 - unfortunately i ran afoul of things that i didn't know existed
43:32 - so i don't think i can hold that against myself but knowing people and reading their
43:40 - reasons for doing things is a hobby of mine
43:45 - i don't i'm more of an observer
43:50 - than i am a participator why do you think you're participating
43:56 - now it's a new thing it's i
44:05 - participate in a certain role in i
44:11 - i have masks and they serve purposes
44:16 - so this is a new one we're going to try this and if it doesn't work
44:22 - we'll go to something else [Music] so
44:29 - you make things appear i do is that what he taught you
44:37 - maybe i just can and
44:43 - they didn't tell you anything about who you are where you came from what your
44:49 - line is they didn't get the opportunity ah
44:56 - they wanted to it can be
45:02 - beneficial to keep a connection with the one who made you
45:10 - you know i used to disagree
45:16 - but now i'm not so sure oh
45:22 - you can always repair that bridge it doesn't have to be permanent a lot of
45:28 - kindred don't have a relationship with the one who made them you do i do to a certain extent is it
45:33 - good it's neutral it's not friendly but it's not bad
45:39 - it is and it has its benefits okay one of the rooms what can i paint
45:46 - one of your rooms sure cool i said don't see why not long there's not on the third floor
45:56 - is that a new project the sheriff will be undertaking yes well
46:05 - meanwhile out on the street speaking of observers you're about a block away
46:11 - a little less than a block not that you went very far
46:16 - less than a block away from isaac's place coming down the sidewalk in the opposite
46:22 - direction towards you looks like there's a group of four or five individuals
46:27 - bundled up against the cold nights warm hats scarves gloves
46:33 - they're talking to each other a couple of them are texting on their phones
46:39 - as they walk you can hear their voices they're talking about
46:44 - mundane things whose grandchild is getting married next
46:49 - and who's going to retire who's been rude to whom in the
46:54 - neighborhood they stop short though as they see you slow their pace

52:47 - they make their goodbyes and wave and set off down the street
52:55 - you arrive at isaac's before we go in
53:00 - before we go in do you ever miss that that is
53:07 - that is the first time in a long time that i've had
53:12 - a pleasant exchange with any stranger
53:18 - that's the first time that i haven't had
53:24 - a voice in the back of my head telling me how poorly this has to end
53:31 - that is the first time that this voice has been quiet
53:38 - in 12 months
53:48 - and i hate what it costs to get there i'm sorry
53:55 - she immediately just hugs you
54:01 - i'm sorry i don't know if it was
54:10 - see everything when i'm around you is i don't know if that my decision was mine or yours
54:19 - um and i don't know what you could tell me to prove to me that it was mine and i
54:25 - don't know if that would be better yeah yeah
54:31 - so let's just go inside
54:37 - say hi to our new friends and maybe just slow everything down just a little bit
54:46 - okay okay
54:51 - okay you let yourselves in yeah
54:58 - i think you're finding uh serif and isaac hi a little art tour how
55:03 - you doing good you're back yeah did you eat you you're full now
55:09 - i'm i'm full yeah great i'm okay
55:15 - good so as i was saying before you left this is now our neighborhood
55:21 - or at least uh the illusion that we control it
55:27 - what do we want to do with it could use some dusting not my place no i'm at the neighborhood
55:34 - well let's take a look at why we have it in the first place okay okay
55:40 - richter felt that we owed him something and in response he gave us land
55:46 - that seems like there's a ulterior motive ulterior motive exactly
55:54 - nice land he gave us well i think the point is that he can't
55:59 - keep track of all of it by himself he needs yes people who
56:05 - presumably fear him that report back to him especially if he wants to expand what he
56:12 - has then he has to have people who look over what he had yeah and all the parts he doesn't really care
56:18 - about so as long as we're playing in the lines that are defined
56:25 - we know what else we have the freedom to do yes so
56:32 - what do we want for this neighborhood
56:37 - am i under the um the idea that you
56:43 - all care about this neighborhood you're all or at least
56:48 - you two are from here correct are you from here from a long time ago yeah
56:55 - wait what's your full name my name is reyes malcolm reyes malcolm although
57:03 - it wasn't malcolm when i was here okay um interesting assimilation tactic
57:10 - yeah it's a really you know non-descript name on a piece of paper yeah okay hold on hold still i feel like
57:17 - i can do this are you related to
57:22 - a rodrigo that lives like i don't know like a mile and a half
57:28 - north of here or maybe you moved around you still live a mile and a half north here i don't know
57:34 - look i remember him from like five or six years ago he looks just like you but like a little younger not like in a bad
57:40 - way you know like melanin but i don't think i've talked to rodrigo oh my god i knew it
57:46 - i know everyone this is my town incredible
57:51 - okay okay i'm sorry what was your question i got lost not the moment i was you
57:57 - answered it by i'm telling you i was right um you're not from here
58:02 - neither well i've been around i'm not originally from here from here now i'm from here now
58:08 - okay that's good so obviously you too i noticed by your face
58:14 - before you came in that you are not pleased with the giant high-rise going up right over there not even a little
58:21 - bit so if we can have some sort of agenda i would love to level those [ __ ]
58:26 - buildings okay well that's a bit of a loss what about something else something less
58:34 - um permanent sure i'm willing to take suggestions i've got three good friends of mine
58:41 - who i think are hurting for a bit of a an artistic expression
58:47 - in myself um i do have my responsibilities in this area so wait what do you do
58:55 - up front um i work with a group called the midnighters
59:01 - hmm
59:08 - you're pretty tapped into the neighborhood yeah they're gang
59:14 - street racers mostly but they're into some worse stuff than that
59:21 - i uh for to be transparent in the
59:27 - effort to make everyone comfortable i
59:33 - the simplest way to put a desire on protection
59:38 - you extort money i extort something else
59:45 - i feed i protect them
59:50 - huh okay okay you've been so incredibly kind
59:55 - and gracious so i'm gonna say uh in the spirit of open
1:00:02 - honesty i would love to slap the [ __ ] out of you right now and i am holding myself back
1:00:08 - well i appreciate your honesty yeah okay
1:00:14 - so i work with them they do their things i am tapped into what they do
1:00:21 - and uh that's where i sit also if you hear somebody call me adam don't be alarmed
1:00:28 - that's just uh adam a different name i go under okay hmm
1:00:34 - okay i think that's it i think is everything i need to say so you don't have a problem with me
1:00:39 - tagging the high-rise i don't care cool there's a neighborhood watch that
1:00:45 - patrols past your door yes i've seen them nothing happens to them
1:00:53 - yeah we're on the same page okay this is an area which i
1:01:00 - do my best to protect okay
1:01:07 - we're gonna have so many conversations later but um they can't talk about it
1:01:13 - i make sure they don't talk about it that's the whole thing i protect them that i get to feed and they don't talk about it
1:01:20 - okay i'm dealing with a lot of mixed emotions right now it's been a big night but i'm gonna let it go tell us what
1:01:26 - you're feeling margo how has how has isaac's revelation about what he
1:01:31 - does in the neighborhood made you feel what does it affect for you i don't have a lot of
1:01:40 - kindred that i know well and trust at all
1:01:48 - but i know what i promised myself
1:01:53 - before i ever was embraced i promised my family i would protect our community
1:01:59 - i dedicated my life to it and i'm dedicating whatever this is to
1:02:04 - it too so i am deeply in conflict at finally having
1:02:10 - someone that understands me but they are just so obviously on the
1:02:15 - wrong side of everything i was taught but then again
1:02:20 - i just told another friend to kill someone for me so i'm having a rough [ __ ] day
1:02:29 - and i'm gonna push it down and deal with it later or not at all
1:02:34 - because i would rather this be easy and good and together and safe
1:02:41 - deal with it later or not at all that is an excellent place i think to
1:02:48 - pause our vampire story for now
1:03:08 - hey everyone i'm yev uh here from new york city now uh victor sent me out here to do some tech work for a friend of his
1:03:14 - i haven't quite met up with them yet but uh but either way very exciting to be sent on location now back to the blazing
1:03:20 - uh big apple as they call it lots of fun things about the uh the big apple uh it's got it's got apples uh they're huge
1:03:28 - uh the nice thing about it is i tend to retain my memory out here back on the west coast uh
1:03:33 - i would lose entire days uh which was super strange uh and very weird uh but
1:03:39 - victor never seemed to be bothered by that in my memory lapses so that was good it didn't affect my employment
1:03:45 - which is great i love everything about it uh i guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the big apple uh i'm
1:03:52 - i'm helping some of his friends or at least i'm supposed to be hopefully soon when they reach out but
1:03:58 - i wanted to to tell you the same thing that i'm going to tell them which is
1:04:03 - if you go to backblaze.com ny by night that's n-y-b-y-n-i-g-h-t
1:04:10 - you can start a free trial of backblaze we'll back up everything on your computer it's movies photos music videos
1:04:17 - contracts covenants i don't know things that are important to fancy business people like victor and
1:04:22 - i'm sure everyone out there as well and you'll have a copy of it available to you wherever you are uh
1:04:28 - maybe on your computer maybe on your phone maybe on your other mobile devices ipads i don't know something anyway go

1:12:03 - welcome back to our vampire the masquerade chronicle new york by night
1:12:10 - season 1 episode 3 avoided and exploited
1:12:15 - and at this point in the evening it's difficult to say who is which
1:12:22 - we are back in isaac's haven the coterie
1:12:29 - seems like his code right now is together again
1:12:34 - and michael your employee
1:12:42 - invites himself into your conversation carrying that aluminum briefcase that
1:12:47 - you may recall oh yeah it's part of your adventure at drexler's taxi dispatch
1:12:54 - briefcase that isaac has claimed to be his
1:12:59 - uh sir yes you wanted to know yes hey everybody hi hi how are you nice to
1:13:06 - see you again uh thanks for asking good good uh you're gonna need a bigger car sir
1:13:12 - yes i realize that we can talk to um monica about that
1:13:19 - something fancy hmm we'll see what we can get oh it's got to be bigger because it has got to be bigger
1:13:25 - okay um well
1:13:30 - i don't know what any of this means i mean i can read the words on the paper and the legal pads
1:13:37 - and the notes um there's not much i can do with the floppy disk i mean
1:13:42 - that's fair we'd need more time maybe you know some people sir maybe or maybe some of you know people
1:13:47 - um cd-roms i mean who uses this stuff anymore that's why i thought it was weird
1:13:53 - yeah this is old uh it's at least a decade out of date maybe longer i'm not sure
1:13:58 - exactly um most of the stuff on the legal pads doesn't mean anything to me it's
1:14:05 - addresses it's names of people i don't never heard of don't recognize
1:14:11 - um does the word shrek net mean anything to
1:14:18 - you sir i don't think so well it doesn't mean anything to me
1:14:24 - either but whatever this stuff is it's got to do with something called shrek net which if you ask me sounds like a
1:14:30 - stupid name for business like the movie yeah yeah something like that
1:14:35 - yeah maybe it's about the movie i don't maybe it's the long last script who knows i don't know
1:14:40 - sir maybe there's somebody you can ask anyway i'll i'll you gotta have you gotta have hardware to read this stuff
1:14:47 - right and i don't i don't have i don't have that that's fine we can maybe maybe some of your friends could um
1:14:53 - to get it for you maybe maybe you maybe you should ask the guy you took it from i don't know
1:14:58 - that's right he probably knows he it was it was
1:15:03 - your stuff was in his place huh yes so um thank you very much michael i will
1:15:10 - look into this i appreciate all the work you did you bet leave it here yes just leave it here okay um
1:15:15 - so can i call monica sure thank you sir take a call
1:15:23 - he excuses himself when he leaves the briefcase on a slip covered coffee table
1:15:30 - great so that's interesting i don't know what it means but i'm sure we'll have to find out one day
1:15:36 - um it's a good idea bigger car yes wait is the biker for us
1:15:43 - yes it's uncomfortable having us all squeezed into a tiny car which reminds me
1:15:49 - isaac what thank you for inviting us to stay here huh you're
1:15:55 - welcome i appreciate the appreciation yeah thanks
1:16:00 - so um interesting shrek net
1:16:07 - i've never heard of that i have a my friend yeti she's like a cousin um she's a couple she's pretty close to
1:16:14 - i need to look at a map but i think she's not too far from here if you just want someone else to look at
1:16:20 - it i trust her maybe direction she's good with technology or cracking things she's good
1:16:26 - with all the ass technology yeah that's something that's good good to keep in mind because drexler had all the
1:16:32 - tech i think to read the stuff yes we can also go by back and bother him although i don't
1:16:37 - particularly see him wanting to help us i want to meet your friend though so yeah he's great leveling with me but i
1:16:44 - am very excited because we now have this territory so why don't we go see what we have
1:16:51 - inherited going to walk maybe oh that sounds so nice yeah okay see where we are what we
1:16:58 - are dealing with uh because i feel like uh if we don't take this seriously it's going to take
1:17:04 - us very seriously if you get what i mean yeah i think i do so
1:17:11 - grab your coats oh yeah okay
1:17:18 - so do i understand correctly that you want to go for a walk yes go see the
1:17:23 - neighborhood see the neighborhood at night yeah yes there's no other time we would see it
1:17:30 - any special preparations that i need to know about uh i'm going to have um i'll go knock on
1:17:37 - uh angela's door you're gonna go upstairs go upstairs the second floor knock on the door and be
1:17:42 - like angela would you mind um coming with us on a walk of course not sir right away thank you yes
1:17:50 - oh your cute little neighborhood watch they're worried about monsters that are here is that you
1:17:57 - not that i'm aware of okay i think i'm particularly monstrous over by the bridge
1:18:02 - the bridges i don't hunt in outside
1:18:08 - okay so before we leave i'm just gonna make a
1:18:14 - quick check in a mirror bathroom or something like that check check the collar for any flecks of blood
1:18:21 - that might have uh made their way yeah there's a bathroom on the first floor and it's got a mirror
1:18:26 - in it i've got a tide pen yeah my purse making sure
1:18:31 - that i still look presentable and you do and the face
1:18:38 - looking back at you from the mirror seems just a little different
1:18:45 - than when you woke up tonight maybe a little bit more
1:18:50 - on its mind put some effort into kind of
1:18:56 - grooming combing making sure everything is uh yes you want to be presentable professional
1:19:02 - always well groomed you were very lucky nothing from sean got on your garments
1:19:11 - uh and uh if possible to say in retrospect i would like to have
1:19:17 - grabbed his wallet not for money not for cards for just for the id just so i requested a name it's better to think of
1:19:24 - those things in the moment but
1:19:30 - i will make you a devil's bargain okay we can say this time only
1:19:37 - that you did take the wallet
1:19:44 - but if you do that you're going to find something in the wallet
1:19:49 - that i guarantee you ray does not want to find
1:19:56 - yeah yeah i'm gonna take it because if anything i think it's gonna serve as a strong
1:20:02 - reminder
1:20:08 - all right we are agreed that you have the wallet
1:20:17 - does that mean you're taking the opportunity to look through it yeah if i'm alone in the bathroom i'll
1:20:24 - thumb through it real quick well
1:20:30 - no cash because who carries cash these days credit cards his id and apparently he was telling
1:20:37 - margot the truth he does live in brooklyn according to his driver's license
1:20:42 - the ordinary identification cards a few scraps of paper shopping list
1:20:48 - and some business cards one of the business cards
1:20:55 - is your friend dante your former co-worker whom you have left behind
1:21:02 - with your previous life and there's a little note
1:21:09 - written on the back it's a date
1:21:15 - three nights from tonight 8 p.m but no address
1:21:24 - apparently they had a rendezvous perhaps a business meeting
1:21:34 - so we set out into the night yes
1:21:40 - the area at least specifically around here is mostly industrial so there's not
1:21:47 - a lot of it's not a highly residential area but there is there are people around living here as
1:21:53 - far as i've gathered okay um yeah let's go see
1:21:59 - boy sure okay
1:22:08 - just making a quick note that's so [ __ ] ominous
1:22:17 - serif have you asked about going to the third floor yet you know i did okay you know i did okay
1:22:25 - so can we just see it so we know no but you know the curiosity is worse right yes but you will have to learn to
1:22:32 - be adults and deal with that don't tell me what to do don't tell me to let you into my
1:22:39 - private area okay okay
1:22:44 - just once okay i'm done
1:22:50 - all right out into the cold
1:22:55 - very early spring night it's later now obviously than when you
1:23:01 - got here and there are fewer people on the streets there are still some
1:23:08 - everybody is dressed warmly against the cold it's a little harder to see their
1:23:13 - features at a distance of course because they're wearing hats and scarves and collars turned up
1:23:21 - you already know where drexler's place is and you can see the cranes operating over at the crescent
1:23:28 - but now you have a chance to stroll assuming you pick no particular
1:23:34 - direction well these are some of the things you see
1:23:39 - along the way there doesn't seem to be a proper club
1:23:45 - of any kind or nightclub in the neighborhood but there is uh well there's at least one bar
1:23:51 - it's a dive and like every neighborhood in every
1:23:57 - city in the world it's irish or so it claims
1:24:02 - according to the sign it says dooley's on the outside
1:24:07 - it looks a lot more like an after hours booze can than it does a respectable establishment but there are
1:24:14 - people inside staying warm i don't know if you could say that they are enjoying their evening but
1:24:21 - beats being out in the cold you pass by a lot of
1:24:26 - vacant warehouses and other storefronts that are for lease things that might have been factories or
1:24:32 - storage areas the businesses you see along the walk
1:24:39 - that still seem to be in operation in this particular part of the neighborhood
1:24:44 - there's a 24-hour laundromat army navy surplus store
1:24:51 - a psychics parlor with a big silver eye painted on the window
1:25:00 - there's a pawn shop
1:25:06 - and a little indie coffee shop not much bigger than a couple of closets stuck
1:25:11 - together with an espresso machine on the counter is it openly
1:25:18 - it is and there are people standing on the sidewalk around it drinking coffee chatting talking
1:25:27 - including your friends from the watch agnes and her crew
1:25:34 - some drinking coffee others drinking cocoa tea miss walker hi

1:28:03 - you as well all the ladies wave to you so
1:28:08 - other than that unnecessary explanation of my abode
1:28:13 - i'm sorry about that is considering the police are not particularly reliable in this section of
1:28:20 - the city check out an rv let's
1:28:25 - considering we are now the protection of this place
1:28:30 - i'll remind you that angela is trailing you yes she
1:28:37 - steps over to you isaac should i go check that out
1:28:42 - or just stay with you stay with us i think we're gonna check it out together as a little official first outing
1:28:50 - but you are very much welcome with us what about this monster is it one is it
1:28:56 - someone we know i have no idea does that sound good no it doesn't we'll
1:29:01 - have to look into that at a later date what do we do
1:29:06 - if there's like another kindred being [ __ ] ratchet
1:29:12 - do we talk to them we talk to them and express our deep
1:29:17 - appreciation if they would leave okay do we like be like richter told us to tell you to
1:29:25 - like i don't do you have something that you can say on behalf of richtek look
1:29:31 - huego no no okay i'm gonna stop talking now okay if i am to understand our
1:29:37 - situation correctly we are in charge unless something requires richter's attention or requires his authority okay
1:29:44 - so i think it's just us to back up any claims we have to back fantastic i've never been like a gang
1:29:51 - before sorry for the question
1:29:58 - are any of you carrying are any of you armed oh yeah absolutely i pull out a spray can
1:30:06 - that's not really what i meant sir no oh i keep a 22. i stay tightly talked did i pull it out of my purse oh no no
1:30:13 - weapons that's more what i was talking about look can you shoot that
1:30:18 - thing can you shoot that thing miss oh that wasn't what i meant but yes
1:30:24 - absolutely what what no i don't know
1:30:30 - sorry so then moving in the
1:30:36 - direction that agnes indicated a few blocks that away you pass by
1:30:45 - various buildings tenement style apartment buildings
1:30:50 - a couple of brownstones in better condition than yours what you might describe as a gray market
1:30:58 - electronics shop filled with iphones that may or may not be legitimately for sale
1:31:05 - shipping company that doesn't looks like it has shipped anything in quite a long time if it ever shipped anything
1:31:15 - doesn't seem to be any subway service in this part of the neighborhood buses yes
1:31:21 - but no subway stations not too long before you find the vacant
1:31:28 - lot and exactly as agnes said there is a big old rv
1:31:34 - parked in it it's an older model it's not falling apart but it's
1:31:39 - certainly not brand new either i think i'd like everybody to make a wit
1:31:44 - and awareness roll will do
1:32:01 - anybody get more than two five for isaac and three for rey
1:32:08 - one for serif okay two okay
1:32:15 - ray you noticed that parked out of sight
1:32:20 - behind the rv is a motorcycle much nicer than the rv
1:32:27 - in good shape well maintained and there's a trailer hitch for it so it
1:32:32 - can be towed behind the rv yeah bounce up on the back exactly
1:32:38 - but with five successes isaac cannot help but notice that the rear
1:32:44 - windows in the rv are painted black
1:32:50 - it would appear that um either the person who owns this harvey
1:32:56 - is uh a little shy or
1:33:03 - they're allergic to the sun in the same way we are if you notice the window is painted
1:33:12 - okay how long did they say this rv had been there oh just a couple days i think
1:33:18 - not sure agnes mentioned they've
1:33:24 - i for sure remember to ask and this is the answer i remember um but
1:33:29 - uh i suggest we approach with all due politeness and uh courtesy and see
1:33:36 - where it goes from there and if we need to make things difficult then we can can i knock on the door okay if you'd like i
1:33:42 - just stroll right up and knock on the door yeah what a daredevil give it a good rap
1:33:52 - there is a knock at your rv door it's at this point that angela
1:33:57 - unholsters her pistol and checks the action but she waits for your instructions
1:34:05 - hello hello may i help you
1:34:12 - um yes could you help me actually what do you need
1:34:18 - um do you live around here uh i live in the rv so
1:34:25 - technically yes okay i'm not getting anywhere with this you're doing great thank you so much um
1:34:32 - we are the neighborhood watch yes we just wanted to check make sure everything was uh okay
1:34:39 - yep everything's fine okay cause some people were worried
1:34:45 - about the car but the rv about the rv correct it's a it's a car it's a big car big car great
1:34:52 - all right let's try this all again what are you doing here oh okay
1:34:58 - i crack the door
1:35:03 - okay when you do that of course they can see a little bit of you perhaps a in the uh
1:35:11 - strip maybe an eye and some black hair and very you know
1:35:16 - very well applied lipstick and a red bit of red leather jacket now
1:35:21 - what is the inhabitant of the rvc how would you describe to a stranger
1:35:28 - what you look like rey is uh uh an older gentleman mid 50s in a
1:35:37 - well tailored suit hair tied back
1:35:42 - shaved on the sides uh kind of a a fit 50 like like jogging in the
1:35:49 - morning kind of 50. what about margo
1:35:54 - uh margo is a like tall slender black woman
1:36:00 - uh with long curly like brown hair and uh just gives off a lot of weirdly
1:36:06 - sunny energy yeah
1:36:11 - seraph is a petite uh impish mixed girl um who has your haircut
1:36:18 - and this outfit [Laughter] nailed it um isaac is a um rather slim and um
1:36:28 - sort of gangly uh individual with um wearing a white shirt uh suspenders and
1:36:36 - red plaid pants uh cuffed and combat boots
1:36:42 - there's also another individual yes there is something who's holding a pistol yes
1:36:49 - she's holding it in front of her she's not threatening anybody with it
1:36:54 - but she's clearly ready to use it has shoulder length wavy dark hair
1:37:00 - very tan skin with a scar on the left side of her face none of you guys have blush of life on
1:37:06 - right now no no i don't believe that they do anymore
1:37:12 - um annabelle peeks through the crack in the door
1:37:19 - well well well what a motley crew
1:37:27 - you guys know that when you are going to introduce yourself to god knows
1:37:34 - what in your assumed territory you probably have a blush of life on right
1:37:41 - i did not know that oh my god i normally do i've just i'm kind of i what we don't
1:37:47 - explain ourselves to you who the [ __ ] are you oh i mean he figured out you were kindred
1:37:52 - from 50 feet away just by looking at your windows so i don't know how much it's worth it
1:37:59 - there's a lot of things that could be explained away by blacked out windows in an rv but not
1:38:05 - breathing is kind of a big giveaway huh
1:38:11 - i'm annabelle by the way who are you uh i'm isaac brooke it's nice to meet
1:38:16 - you sarah fuego ray and this is angela uh-huh
1:38:22 - you're the neighborhood watch okay well now that we are certain you're kindred
1:38:28 - it is more that this is our territory okay it's new
1:38:34 - can we come inside or you come outside this is so [ __ ] awkward
1:38:41 - right i am open up the door and i step out
1:38:49 - uh you guys aren't camarilla
1:38:54 - though no right is that how it's said i say camarilla i've been saying camarilla this whole time yeah i've only
1:39:01 - seen it written down the finer points of pronunciation seem to be
1:39:07 - a hotly debated topic up to so you're interpretation camarilla
1:39:13 - no but you own this territory recently recently huh okay yes a stranger we
1:39:20 - don't have to give like i mean well yeah okay recently recently
1:39:27 - i've lived here under new ownership under new management that was what i was gonna put
1:39:33 - on this brick wall i was walking past i was just waiting for the right moment but yes on the new management
1:39:38 - i like your jacket thank you that's very precious to me like your whole deal oh my god thank you
1:39:45 - very precious to me
1:39:50 - what do you guys know about what's that happened in los angeles nothing in los angeles no there's a new
1:39:57 - timothy chalamet movie yeah yeah okay who's timothy
1:40:03 - oh well it kind of looks like you but younger oh my god yeah yeah yeah yeah the ultimate sort of wafey
1:40:10 - yeah british sad boy you get it oh
1:40:16 - all right well to give you just a little
1:40:23 - summation of everything camera came in tried to take over anarchs fought back it was a hotly
1:40:30 - contested war lost a lot of good people and then the inquisition swept in
1:40:36 - got rid of the camarilla uh and despite
1:40:44 - everybody's best efforts
1:40:52 - well you know sometimes i think about if
1:40:57 - there was a happy ending to that chapter of my life or not
1:41:04 - but i'm here because we managed to restart the anarch free states
1:41:10 - which we yeah
1:41:16 - this is like the second secret war that we've learned about in as many nights yeah we absolutely have to ask then um
1:41:23 - are you responsible for the interesting news taking place in new york right now yeah which piece did you murder the
1:41:31 - baron i did not oh in serious circumstances right um yes
1:41:37 - no i don't know about that are you guys on the case can i see if she's lying i would like to roll
1:41:43 - an inside check hmm look at her body language your tone of
1:41:49 - voice annabelle are you concealing anything that you want to protect or defend
1:41:56 - or do you just want to make it difficult for him on general principles
1:42:02 - yeah yeah i'm not going to get everything uh annabelle please make a dice pool you
1:42:08 - have wow um why don't you make it um
1:42:15 - what's an insight what's an insect okay for you um and for annabelle why don't we roll
1:42:24 - excellent my role manipulation and leadership manipulation would be at the top with
1:42:30 - the attributes and the social um leadership skill
1:42:37 - i think that gives you i'm also gonna
1:42:42 - i'm gonna activate i'm gonna activate ah okay here we go
1:42:48 - it's free for you at uh add three dice
1:42:53 - that's a lot of dice
1:43:00 - six ah wonderful that would be seven with a messy critical
1:43:06 - a messy critical now
1:43:14 - consequences of messy criticals of course is that the beast acts out yes
1:43:21 - but merely scrutinizing someone's body language doesn't seem like an opportunity for the
1:43:28 - beast to lash out violently at all so
1:43:33 - i don't think that flying off the handle is a likely outcome for isaac instead
1:43:40 - what i propose is hmm two things
1:43:52 - obviously you get hungrier
1:44:00 - well i'm sure we don't know who she is darling but she looks delicious
1:44:07 - doesn't she and we know you feel packaged so perhaps it's a little nibble i feel like that
1:44:12 - would be impolite considering the current situation hmm you can afford to be rude this is your
1:44:19 - territory you make a good point she is in your domain
1:44:25 - yes but we don't normally make the habit of feeding on another kindred do we in addition to getting
1:44:31 - hungrier your compulsion comes into play
1:44:38 - so of course compulsion of your clan
1:44:44 - is rather inconvenient yes it is you must possess
1:44:49 - something in this scene yes and leave it for you to decide
1:44:54 - what it is that you plan to possess could be an item
1:45:00 - place an individual but every role you make that has nothing to do with satisfying
1:45:07 - your compulsion will be made at penalty through the door
1:45:13 - of the rv what do i see
1:45:18 - i had only cracked it and then there wasn't anything visible at this point then you stepped out stepped up
1:45:29 - interesting what what do i want to possess while you ponder that
1:45:36 - margot your phone beeps it's a message tone wolf
1:45:43 - immediately pull it out it's a text from matteo
1:45:51 - it's just a series of photos of you dancing in the cage with richter
1:45:56 - taken from below yeah
1:46:01 - look i know right what is that from mateo yeah of course of course
1:46:08 - so my ex-boyfriend was at a club when i was uh hooking up with wow we're really
1:46:14 - telling you no no let the ladies speak yeah yeah yeah what do you want to see the photos yes look at this i fully
1:46:20 - passed my photo i didn't know she was that flexible yeah right yeah
1:46:26 - it's photographs of uh margot and uh yeah yeah uh a good-looking well-built
1:46:32 - gentleman uh tired in a kind of an eclectic uh combination of clothing it looks like
1:46:38 - he's wearing a dress shirt sleeves vests slacks and
1:46:43 - doc martens he's got strong features great jaw and they are in a
1:46:49 - metal cage who appears to be suspended over a dance floor maybe in a nightclub there's a lot of floodlights and
1:46:55 - spotlights playing around and they are enjoying themselves this is
1:47:02 - rad as hell is that the ex no the person who texted the photos is the
1:47:08 - x he was watching from under oh i know he wasn't like a good term
1:47:14 - not even a little bit i don't know you yeah but i also
1:47:20 - i know you thank you i felt a vibe in the beginning amazing yeah oh that's great so that's
1:47:27 - great not to interrupt this pleasant conversation but okay what was your position in said rebellion
1:47:36 - every revolution needs you know a poster child
1:47:41 - how is that poster child and i wouldn't say i was exactly a mastermind behind anything or
1:47:48 - really did that much in my opinion but i think
1:47:56 - you know being new to everything as i was when it all started
1:48:01 - i kind of reminded everybody that they could be more
1:48:06 - they had it in them that's so nice that's really nice yeah do you
1:48:14 - have any anything from that time any any physical
1:48:22 - representation of what happened there proof as it were
1:48:30 - yeah like a physical item yeah
1:48:37 - i mean even a photograph i've got um
1:48:47 - i pull up some of the articles on my phone
1:48:53 - the headlines screaming about baron temple and uh nellie g she shows you
1:49:01 - photographs of individuals who appear to have had a lot of publicity
1:49:07 - in los angeles press newspaper articles blogs
1:49:15 - the occasional newscast they appear to be connected with the entertainment and fashion industries
1:49:22 - and i pull out adrian's cross steak
1:49:30 - what does that look like it's a rough-hewn wooden cross simple handmade
1:49:38 - that has a sharp end to it interesting
1:49:43 - may i it's still covered in my blood i reach out man
1:49:49 - sure it is in fact covered up to the hilt up to the cross
1:49:54 - piece in dark dried blood or possibly a vitae
1:50:02 - you someone else mine whoa very interesting okay well i'll carry but very
1:50:09 - interesting the inquisition swept in
1:50:15 - and absolutely raised
1:50:20 - so much of kindred society to the ground in los angeles because we could not be united against
1:50:26 - them right sounds like
1:50:32 - a problem and i feel like it explains why you're not there but why are you here yeah that's a
1:50:39 - good question because in the end we beat them back we got the inquisition out and now the
1:50:45 - free states are back we don't have to play pay the blood tax
1:50:52 - or live under the boot of oppression of the camarilla you cannot conquer
1:50:59 - somebody who does not want to be conquered you cannot be an occupying force forever
1:51:05 - it might take in 10 years 50 years 100
1:51:12 - but they'll be kicked out eventually so you're saying that the the camarilla camarilla
1:51:18 - walked into la what was it like before where you said these free states were
1:51:24 - re-established what was it like before they came in everybody kind of did their own thing
1:51:30 - i like that yeah yeah but the problem is that that's not how manhattan works
1:51:38 - how does manhattan work no but [ __ ] manhattan not a situation
1:51:43 - where the camarilla is just kinda turning up they're there
1:51:48 - that's they own that island this is not a
1:51:54 - situation of maintaining one's territory this would be
1:52:00 - so much different for you this would be this would be war you would be the invading party
1:52:07 - i'm curious did you come here to stir up people against the camarilla
1:52:14 - only if you want to be stirred up i mean i mean don't you
1:52:19 - like freedom i do like that yes but um from my
1:52:25 - perspective living here in this area which is far
1:52:31 - away from camarilla territory i have never met anybody from the
1:52:36 - camarilla me as far as i know i am aware they exist i know what they are
1:52:42 - they don't come here they don't care about here that's not necessarily true i've met a
1:52:49 - few but there's a reason i'm here not in manhattan yeah
1:52:55 - they have aims bigger than one island well i'm sure they do but they have never come to my
1:53:01 - door well you know i mean as long as they're not at your door
1:53:06 - specifically i guess that's all right then why are you expecting me to go fight for a bunch of people i don't know i like
1:53:12 - this terror i like this area i like the people in this neighborhood okay all right all right so just supposing that
1:53:18 - you don't care about people outside of your territory or about because that's fine you got to take care of your own
1:53:25 - how long do you think it's going to be before a group that is known for being
1:53:31 - expansionist and has a strong hold on one very powerful piece of property is
1:53:36 - going to make their way into your territory not long i imagine i don't know they've
1:53:41 - been in manhattan for a long time they seem rather comfortable there i think they're going to hit other islands
1:53:47 - before they hit here so you're going to give them time to amass that power in the other islands
1:53:53 - before they get to here yes but i can also move i don't need to fight you don't
1:54:00 - you never need to fight you never need to do anything that's uncomfortable for you
1:54:07 - or that puts you out of your way but if it's the right thing to do why
1:54:12 - wouldn't you um i see what you're saying i see your
1:54:17 - point but i think the right thing to do is subjective to the person who's
1:54:25 - putting forward the statement yeah very much so you're trying to uh
1:54:30 - logic away a moral dilemma is that
1:54:37 - interesting it makes things simpler to look at it from that perspective
1:54:43 - is there a reason why at this very moment that i need to go and rally against a force in another island no
1:54:48 - have they done anything yet no so there's no need to take action wasn't richter talking about
1:54:56 - a war between camaria and sabbat yes
1:55:01 - neither of which we are involved in wait how long ago was that
1:55:07 - oh yes years ago the thing he was asking me about um it was a number of years ago something to do with
1:55:14 - the sabbath which i i lied a little um know a little bit about them
1:55:22 - vampires who uh kindred who decided that uh because they are kindred they can do whatever they want
1:55:29 - and feed however they want to be in plain sight however they want basically
1:55:34 - and when you're talking about freedom you're not talking about that
1:55:40 - you're talking about truly have as little to do with us is so what
1:55:46 - makes the rules that you still live by different than the rules the camarilla
1:55:51 - would have us live by the sad part is is because we are ruled by
1:55:59 - our beast that voice in our head that tells us to do the thing
1:56:06 - it's hard to be that different from the camera
1:56:12 - and therein lies the point but well you're gonna you're gonna risk your life to kick them out of manhattan just to
1:56:19 - just to live the same life
1:56:24 - we can't let perfection be the enemy of the good
1:56:29 - maybe we can't kick him out of manhattan but we sure [ __ ] can keep him out of here yeah
1:56:35 - they're trying to push in absolutely if they're they're trying to push in
1:56:41 - yeah well i if it's them that's something yet to be
1:56:46 - proven there's gentrification and things happening in in the area and all over
1:56:52 - new york it could be controlled by them but we have no absolute proof that it is
1:56:58 - i'm i'm just going to say too even if it's just normal human gentrifiers [ __ ] them too
1:57:03 - i like yeah i like so much so much what's your name annabelle
1:57:08 - yeah okay cool so i don't want to get the wrong idea i
1:57:14 - have nothing against you i just was curious as to why you were doing the things you do and why you're here in this specific territory
1:57:21 - because it seems far away from the actual problem not that far
1:57:26 - oh new york's an actual problem right now and i had to meet with uh baron tork
1:57:32 - ah oh [ __ ] yeah wow thoughts
1:57:39 - on torque do you know have you left torque do what is why why is torque why do you let
1:57:46 - that happen he said he was in charge because he said he was in charge i don't agree with it either we were actually
1:57:52 - planning on paying kendrick for like 20 [ __ ] minutes and he's been barren for less yeah it's true um he doesn't this
1:57:59 - is richton's territory not um he was in the pictures in the cake sorry that was him that was right
1:58:06 - there that's the other yeah yes um
1:58:13 - wow richter owns this territory we are uh he gifted it to us yes why we did a
1:58:20 - favor for him he gave us this what's the favorite you'd think you would think that but it
1:58:26 - wasn't no that was just what i did that would have it would be a completely different name much nicer good for you thank you um
1:58:39 - i feel like torque is nothing torque is nothing and if rulers
1:58:46 - like that are ruling in new york versus the camarilla then um
1:58:52 - they get pushed over yeah we can just march through because again
1:58:58 - they're always going to be lockstep because they are the establishment they are the status quo they have all the
1:59:04 - resources and uh you know all the time and patience that a lot of anarchs don't have and
1:59:13 - they have an agreement on what is best which is what is best
1:59:19 - for them the camarilla anarchs always have a different idea of what's best well i can't disagree with
1:59:25 - that and i normally would say fight from within that's kind of what
1:59:30 - i've done my whole life of uh being on the inside a little bit but
1:59:37 - as you can see i deal with problems a little differently these nights i don't particularly hold any
1:59:42 - real love for the anarchs either it's just the best place to sit
1:59:49 - yeah i didn't join up with them i didn't decide to become one of their
1:59:55 - members i just lived in an area that was anarch when i was
2:00:01 - turned yeah it's kind of the last seat left in the lunchroom situation
2:00:06 - well i don't know how but people find me off putting
2:00:11 - you just have to blink more i mean we don't
2:00:17 - technically need to be yeah i know really but annabelle your phone buzzes
2:00:24 - it's a text message from eleanor
2:00:29 - it says look familiar question mark
2:00:35 - she sends you a photo that she's clearly taken herself on her phone it's a poster
2:00:42 - poster of a band and the band is called
2:00:48 - bronx cheer and there are three individuals in the poster
2:00:55 - presumably the band two women and a man

2:01:58 - what kind of experiments i don't know blood magic experiments oh [ __ ] there's blood magic apparently you can do matt
2:02:07 - what the [ __ ] why didn't we get magic i don't know i don't know
2:02:12 - well i kind of did well yeah you can make illusions and [ __ ]
2:02:17 - god damn it how old are all of you
2:02:22 - yes four older than the baron's been the baron yeah
2:02:28 - like six months seven months it's 12 months
2:02:34 - not years you don't have anybody that can like
2:02:42 - show you the ropes i do still learning
2:02:48 - he doesn't live here though they don't live here i don't know what they are now you're not offering to be our den mother
2:02:55 - are you i mean i can't really stick around in one place for too long
2:03:01 - but you know i have some select words that i'd want to share with you that i wish i'd heard
2:03:08 - when i was your age oh i would love to know all right hold on you may have been
2:03:13 - kindred longer than i have but i've been on this earth longer than you and you think that all of the things that you
2:03:18 - are learned as a human no i just meant a little respect that's that was all okay
2:03:25 - he holds the door open for people whoa really nice it is really nice politeness is important
2:03:33 - i wouldn't mind if you're trying to share knowledge i wouldn't mind hearing it
2:03:46 - who's your sire oh um
2:03:52 - oh his name is uh rafferty he's
2:03:58 - a ventrue in the camarilla
2:04:03 - but we don't talk yeah okay i can't believe you didn't tell me about this earlier what am i
2:04:10 - supposed to say it's fair i i've known you for a little bit it's talking about how long i've known you you're right
2:04:15 - it's just a sore subject okay i can't be the only one with sire issues here you're that's correct
2:04:21 - no i think it's literally the opposite i'm the only one who doesn't have sire issues okay
2:04:27 - oh god you got a little house about it
2:04:32 - you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to i don't i'm not a sh
2:04:41 - here's what i know the camarilla have their eyes on the bronx
2:04:48 - because we are all hungry things and we're never not hungry
2:04:56 - and best i can tell he tried to turn me in order to
2:05:01 - cement a foothold here my whole family's from here everyone i
2:05:07 - know is from here i was part of the neighborhood council
2:05:13 - but he turned me told me very little
2:05:18 - and now i don't see him anymore and i hate him but the worst part
2:05:24 - is that i miss him so [ __ ] much and i don't know if that's
2:05:31 - because of how the embrace works but it's bad
2:05:40 - oh and we're all staring at me now [ __ ] sorry sorry that does change slightly my opinion on whether or not the camarilla
2:05:46 - is coming here sorry
2:05:52 - and i'm sorry to do this in front of everybody but you know when
2:05:59 - you were turned that was a traumatic event
2:06:04 - i mean you died you were murdered you were murdered
2:06:09 - and not everybody chose this life and so you have ptsd right now
2:06:17 - and for me it took a number of years if i was able to
2:06:22 - work through my daddy issues and also
2:06:28 - reconcile trauma like this is full-blown trauma and we don't have therapists for whatever
2:06:35 - reason i'm not i'm not arguing i just i technically agreed
2:06:41 - so that's nice i was given a choice i wasn't yeah i'm just like it
2:06:48 - you are a lucky exception yes that does the rule i'm sure you have your own
2:06:54 - issues but i think we've established 10 times over that you're unique
2:07:01 - huh that's a good thing okay
2:07:06 - we all have a very unique
2:07:13 - aspect of our our trauma and that our trauma talks to us
2:07:21 - our trauma talks to us our trauma tells us to do things in and in the most literal sense like you know when you're
2:07:28 - a human here's that [ __ ] and you do what what we all hear that [ __ ] yeah yeah
2:07:35 - yeah okay okay we have a little voice in our head that tells us to do things that have to do with the way that we were
2:07:41 - traumatized mind changes oh that's nice so
2:07:47 - be kind to yourself in that journey
2:07:53 - because it sucks it sucks when you're not gonna know everything at once even if you have somebody that's showing you the ropes
2:08:00 - it's like they don't know what they don't know especially after a long while depending how old they are then you might not even remember to tell you
2:08:06 - stuff like blush of life or you know that um i don't know
2:08:11 - you can't smell anything anymore but other people can smell stuff on you
2:08:16 - oh i hadn't even thought that's what makes a lot of sense right god i hadn't noticed so
2:08:22 - yeah i'm in good luck with all of that thank you by managing that
2:08:27 - and managing what is currently happening and going to happen to the bronx
2:08:34 - i don't want anything to happen to the bronx well i mean we can only control the small amount of territory that we have
2:08:39 - we don't control the whole bronx that would be ridiculous oh yeah i'd like some things to happen the bronx that like to get a little better but you know
2:08:45 - yeah but not yeah not in this i um also i don't mean to come off like we don't want you here we just wanted to
2:08:52 - figure out why you were here because people in the neighborhood were worried there was a random rv parked out
2:08:58 - somewhere and they wanted to know i can see who was there and why his windows were blacked out and things like that
2:09:04 - sure i mean for a bunch of nimbys and everything yeah yeah a bunch of what oh
2:09:09 - not in my backyards oh yeah no no i think they're just more like old
2:09:14 - and bored okay i don't have to defend well also apparently there's a monster walking around the area so oh yeah is that you please don't let that be you no
2:09:21 - under the bridge sometimes you're doing like a little troll hunting thing no okay we'll work on that
2:09:27 - later then have i heard anything about this i noticed anything
2:09:33 - eleanor certain hasn't mentioned it and none of the kindred you've spoken to in the brief time that you've been in new
2:09:40 - york have mentioned anything like that but maybe you're not talking to the right
2:09:46 - people yet also do you know what shrek net is yeah yeah what what yeah that's like the
2:09:52 - vampire internet oh we have a whole [ __ ] in why doesn't anyone tell me [ __ ]
2:09:59 - anything you have a way to access that that would have made things so much easier i don't uh not not anymore that was no i mean
2:10:07 - certainly you recall that there were conversations between
2:10:14 - victor and mitnick and yev about trying to recreate that network now that
2:10:22 - it has been destroyed but i don't think there were any ever ever any conversations about them being
2:10:29 - successful oh so they didn't get it back up it was it was taken down oh oh there was
2:10:37 - it's the whole thing with with government agencies and and like
2:10:42 - nosferatu they're really good at tech there's talk of trying to get it back online
2:10:48 - okay like it was just something i heard recently and i was just curious i thought you might know why
2:10:53 - what did you find out about it i read the word and i wanted to know what it meant
2:11:00 - where did you read it acquired something that had the word written on it was a piece of paper some
2:11:05 - floppy disks some cd realms cd floppy disks do you happen to have
2:11:10 - anything that reads that stuff from before yeah are you old enough to remember what those are uh
2:11:16 - is that the little thing for the save icon yeah yes
2:11:22 - it would be the thing yes i think yeah my mom's yes yes that's what the slave icon is based off
2:11:29 - i forget that you're kind of older than that annabelle it is at this point that you
