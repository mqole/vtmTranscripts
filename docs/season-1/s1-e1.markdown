3:26 - this company remember yev is canon

3:35 - prologue why this story

3:41 - why this city now they don't know it yet but it's a

3:46 - new night for the kindred of new york and we invite you now to learn along with us

3:53 - what this new night holds for its vampires

3:58 - we've chosen to gaze through new york's looking glass darkly because that makes

4:04 - the little shards of light all the more valuable

4:09 - in the real world redemption seems to be on sale at every newsstand drugstore and

4:16 - boutique but in the world of darkness it is frighteningly less available

4:24 - these vampires will be given opportunities for action and depending on what they decide

4:31 - they may prevail in the pursuit of their ambitions or they may undo themselves through

4:37 - their own conscious choices we should remember too as we walk these nighttime streets

4:45 - that these kindred are monsters now some of them are stylishly seductive

4:52 - monsters but they still rise each night to consume the blood of the living

4:59 - and even the most rational and moral among them will eventually

5:05 - inevitably however temporarily give in to their irrational

5:11 - monstrous side the beast this is the price

5:18 - our vampires pay for their undead power it's the price of immortality

5:26 - and that is the very least that these new york knights have to offer

5:32 - so each of our kindred must ask themselves throughout our chronicle

5:39 - do we settle for this or do we can we

5:45 - make our own lives into something more with this

5:51 - firmly in mind let's tell the vampire story

6:08 - [Music]

6:35 - [Music]

6:45 - [Music]

6:57 - [Music]

7:11 - [Music]

7:23 - let's begin our vampire story with a little history a little

7:28 - kindred lore new york city was at the brink of the new millennium

7:35 - a battleground between rival sects of vampires the camarilla

7:42 - and the sabbath home to millions of mortals and hundreds

7:48 - of vampires the city shook as the conflict took the form of

7:54 - economic espionage and political manipulation and outright physical violence on

8:00 - and below the streets in the end

8:06 - the camera succeeded in driving the sabbat out of the city

8:12 - and if the camarilla rule was unsettled immediately after the war

8:17 - the last two decades have solidified its rule into a more or less stable

8:23 - configuration although not everyone is entirely pleased with the shape

8:29 - of that structure now the anarchs of new york were at first

8:34 - deeply suspicious of the new prince that was chosen after the war but they have come to find her more

8:41 - tolerable than a more inflexible autocrat

8:47 - spared some of the obvious sources of friction by the new prince's willingness to bend a little bit and accommodate

8:54 - reality new york's kindred have built what seems to be a more or less stable foundation

9:03 - on which they can pursue their individual and collective goals for a time

9:10 - but to the victor go the spoils and after ousting the sabbath the camera

9:17 - lost no time in ensuring that their spoils were the best spoils

9:23 - the camera claims domain over the entire city and the anarchs have found themselves

9:30 - under their ostensible leader baron callahan relegated mostly to the borough of the

9:37 - bronx and what is the bronx it's a borough in new york city of

9:42 - course it's 1.5 million living people in about

9:48 - 42 square miles and 50 neighborhoods more or less famously diverse

9:55 - famously vibrant famously violent a place of very sharp contrasts and

10:02 - breathtaking human intensity

10:09 - what part of the bronx are we in we're in hunts point a single square mile in south bronx

10:18 - relatively cut off from the rest of the borough by the bronx river and wide expanses of railroad tracks and the

10:25 - bruckner expressway most of the neighborhood is factories and

10:31 - warehouses for light industry glass auto parts what is in factories is one of the

10:38 - largest food distribution networks in america

10:43 - and all that food goes someplace else anywhere else

10:49 - except the bronx not many people come down here at night

11:00 - imagine it with us you're standing on the shore of the east

11:06 - river dirty water laps along a dingy shore

11:12 - littered with car tires broken furniture and a lot of plastic if you turn south

11:19 - you're looking out across the dark cold water at the unblinking lights of wreckers

11:24 - island and its infamous prison and beyond that

11:30 - the borough of queens for many who live in the bronx

11:35 - it feels like they spend a lot of time looking out over water at other places across

11:42 - distances that seem very close only a bridge away and yet

11:49 - all too distant now if you turn around 180 degrees with

11:55 - your back to the river you face the cage a nightclub built into the shell of a

12:01 - decommissioned cement factory three stories of brick concrete graffiti and

12:08 - attitude its exterior is a lattice work of fire escapes and metal catwalks

12:14 - that connect to the old cement making machinery that loom over the river like rusting

12:20 - skeletons this is where our kindred were asked to come tonight

12:27 - cage isn't open yet too early in the evening but there are people here clustered around a big metal loading bay

12:34 - set of doors on the side of the building the light spilling out of the loading bay

12:40 - illuminates the people carrying musical instruments sound gear

12:45 - boxes from vehicles into the club but you can't hear

12:50 - what the people are saying from your vantage point the wind is off

12:55 - the river tonight and the wind is cold so are you

13:03 - this is the first time you have ever seen each other before what do you want to do

13:16 - are we all just waiting around at this point seems that way

14:34 - why are your taxes a problem aren't they all i like every tax i feel

14:39 - like is a problem thank you yeah so you were all also invited here to uh fix

14:47 - the problem i think mine's just a misunderstanding mine's not

14:53 - mine's very straightforward that somebody else [ __ ] up oh very easy to understand yeah

15:00 - okay yeah it's big guy energy yeah

15:06 - is yours a problem not for me oh apparently for

15:11 - the one who called us here it's a problem is this club any good no i don't know i

15:16 - don't know no girl clubs oh it's fine oh okay like

15:23 - i don't know for like down here but it gets really noisy when they do some of the shipping like late night whatever

15:29 - that'll really mess up the vibe though yeah you know what the vibe here is [ __ ] and that's not just because i'm

15:35 - nervous to go talk to richter oh why

15:41 - you seem confident though yeah you can be both i contain multitudes don't

15:47 - feed off of people that he would say is are his people look there needs to be

15:53 - some sort of branding system i'm new to this and i didn't know you could call dibs on people and it's just whatever

15:58 - it's fine it's fine how how how new

16:04 - i don't think a lady's supposed to tell yeah rude i'm kind of new to it okay thank you no

16:11 - bro less than a year oh don't tell isaac i won't i didn't hear anything

16:22 - been about a year from me oh okay

16:27 - you don't seem very happy about it well it's it's kind of what landed me here so

16:34 - it's not exactly uh not exactly been the highlight of my

16:39 - time on this earth but i mean we're all kind of equals at

16:45 - this point so that's exactly why it's not the highlight of my time on this earth

16:51 - okay i'm going to choose to not take that person yes you you know

16:57 - you learn to take things less personally as it goes

17:03 - i hope so i don't think much personally but that's just more of a you know life motto from life motto i

17:10 - take everything personally well i think uh serif is going to have an easier time in nights going forward okay don't tell

17:18 - me how to live i'm not telling you how to live i'm just telling you that most kindred

17:24 - eventually get snappy with each other

17:30 - you can hear music coming from the open loading bay doors in the club now it's not a band

17:37 - somebody's checking the sound system maybe over by the loading bay doors

17:45 - somebody shouts curses they've dropped an amp people are very upset about this this

17:51 - equipment is very very expensive a couple more vehicles arrive

17:58 - vans trucks more people get out start hauling boxes

18:04 - mics instrument cases apparently there's going to be a party

18:12 - no one's paying any attention to you yet should we be helping is there anyone

18:18 - else out here stopping us from going in is there like hmm that's a good question a guard

18:25 - at all well if you approach closer leaving the river behind you

18:31 - some things become apparent serif i'd like you to make a roll for me

18:39 - let's make it your intelligence plus your street wise [Music]

18:47 - something here that you might recognize you in particular okay

18:55 - three successes three successes as you approach the building heading for

19:01 - the loading bay doors where all the activity is you notice that the uh place is covered

19:06 - in graffiti nice yeah most of it's i mean it's not up to your standards

19:12 - yeah yeah acceptable at least it's good that they're trying but there are

19:18 - two signs in the graffiti that stand out to you one of which you recognize

19:23 - one of which you don't one of them is a crown

19:29 - a stylized crown above the initials lp and you know that that's the sign of the

19:35 - los perdidos the lost ones a gang a big gang

19:41 - an important gang the other one looks like a stylized version of the word

19:47 - fang that resembles a mouthful of sharp teeth with the f and the g ending in points

19:52 - like well like fangs that's fun and playful

19:59 - to answer your question ray the people moving in and out of the loading bay carrying the instruments

20:05 - boxes and other supplies don't seem to be paying attention to you

20:11 - and there is no guard at the door you are just observing closely

20:18 - growing ever more impatient i got stuff to do with my night if uh richter

20:25 - isn't calling us in

20:30 - then uh i go in and have this conversation uh sooner rather than later

20:39 - approaching the loading bay doors

20:44 - an individual who was just leaning up against the wall of the building detaches herself

20:50 - and moves to intercept you she's distinctive

20:58 - her face has fine almost elephant features big big eyes hiding behind eyeglasses

21:04 - just flame red hair and tight curls petite slender

21:10 - she's wearing a little black dress that's really more appropriate for a cocktail party than

21:15 - a bronx rager accessorized with some soft knee-high boots with flat heels

21:22 - velvet opera gloves and a lot of gold jewelry hey killer you're on time yeah

21:30 - absolutely in fact you know i've been waiting a couple minutes i was wondering if richter was going to have us wait all

21:35 - [ __ ] night because uh you know we might order some take out or

21:40 - something like that take out that's good the boss likes them funny yeah that was kind of the problem

23:12 - yeah that's the way it is killer oh boy hey look you were on time and the boss likes that so points in your favor

23:19 - as for who he's you know most angry at i mean it's hard to say

23:26 - we'll all find out very very soon hey like i said i'm consuela

23:32 - welcome to the cage we're all very excited tonight there's a new band the bronx cheer

23:50 - and we're all done being obnoxious let's go on in i'm gonna lead the way

23:56 - don't mind if i do please come on in follow me she leads you through the opening loading bay doors you can see

24:05 - past her the main floor of the club where they're setting up for tonight a huge cavernous space that's mostly a

24:11 - dance floor and what isn't dance floor is well his bar really

24:17 - a huge metal cage the namesake of the club perhaps hangs suspended high above the dance

24:24 - floor from industrial grade chains and it's obvious that it's made

24:30 - to dance in somebody's on stage testing the amps and

24:35 - your clothes you know vibrate from a sound system that mistakes base for volume

24:40 - consuela gestures left which is a metal stairway leading upwards and you can see several men lounging on the landing

24:47 - evidently standing guard the boss is up there

24:52 - but he said to give you a little tour first she spins on her heel

24:57 - 90 degrees instead of going up it takes you down the opposite stairway

25:04 - leading you to the lower level and through several cramped brick quarters with a lot of doors you

25:10 - pass open storage areas people carrying boxes of liquor beer kegs a lot of ice

25:17 - they relax they're joking with each other as they go about their business but each and every one of them gives

25:23 - consuela a wide berth and those few who do look at her

25:30 - look either very respectful or very afraid

25:36 - this is the pit i wanted to show you the pit victor made sure you saw the pit

25:42 - what is the pit used for take a look uh this was apparently a large area

25:49 - meant to maybe mix cement and you're not sure there's a huge deep metal line hole

25:54 - sunk into the floor and now there are several people working on it turning it slowly into

26:01 - some kind of arena installing aluminum beak bleachers

26:06 - around the rim lighting yeah this is gonna be like you know mma boxing and uh

26:13 - you know special sports for our kind

26:18 - all right like a fight a fight club okay yeah that's cool exactly

26:24 - just like in the movie yeah maybe uh maybe some of you will be into that

26:31 - maybe not really yeah neither

26:36 - suit yourselves thank you for the offer that's so sweet maybe you'll come watch that's more my

26:42 - thing i like spectators all right can we take a cue from the movie and stop talking about the fight club

26:47 - uh see the boss is gonna like you except for the thing you did but you

26:52 - know what did he do i want to know so bad i want to know so about really curious

26:59 - next stop on the tour is our tanning salon she leads you through another corridor

27:06 - to a steel door that obviously doesn't belong in this building

27:11 - it's from someplace else maybe a bank vault you're not sure it's massive and thick has one of those huge wheels

27:18 - in the center of it but it's already open so she simply uses a finger to swing it wide and

27:25 - beyond it you see a small room with crumbling cement walls and strangely

27:31 - an old style barber shop chair bolted to the floor oh i get it

27:39 - directly above a glass skylight

27:44 - yeah that makes sense yeah the tracks yeah okay so this is our tanning salon

27:50 - playful name i like it this is you know this is what happens so you don't want to come down here look

27:57 - i mean it's a great town but kind of permanent consuela can we just have a if you're trying to intimidate us you've

28:04 - done it i'm not trying to do anything sweetheart okay i'm just giving you the tour uh-huh

28:10 - just like the boss said uh-huh all right i think that's enough tour

28:16 - yeah let's go up she leads you to a

28:22 - freight elevator she gets in with you

28:28 - the door is closed she pushes a button and the lift begins to move upwards

28:36 - how do you how do you get a gig like this consuela me yeah it sounds like a hell of a gig

28:41 - oh this is the best job i've ever had and i've had a lot of jobs yeah yeah i wasn't very good at most of them

28:47 - but i'm good at this yeah i hit that yeah you might uh think of me as sort of like the night manager oh maybe the

28:53 - promoter you know kind of um kind of run the show more or less

28:58 - i mean airbox wouldn't agree but you know [ __ ] him who's the air box you'll find out okay

29:16 - polite honest i mean polite more or less yeah i mean i wouldn't piss him off but i'm not you

29:23 - hmm you ready show time

29:31 - the elevator comes to a halt and the doors open directly into what must be

29:37 - the meeting area and there's someone waiting at the elevator

29:46 - dark-haired pale woman dressed in what you might be described as

29:51 - 1950s vintage with a dark twist she's carrying a leather briefcase

29:58 - and she smiles when she sees you hey

30:03 - collection night you're here too are we having met i'm cat cat costello

30:10 - hello cat of the woodlong costellos no no no but i'm isaac it's nice to meet you nice to

31:02 - nice to meet you too come up to woodlawn and see me sometime sure i sound like a threat

31:13 - she waits for you to exit the elevator and then she gets on and the door is

31:18 - closed behind you cat costello is gone wherever she's going

31:24 - [Applause] now in this room there's a table almost as long as the room itself

31:29 - stretching from the nearly the elevator doors all the way to the opposite wall with a lot of

31:35 - chairs most of them are vacant but you'd guess they're seating for at least a couple of dozen here

31:42 - the brick walls are painted over a matte black ceiling's the same color

31:49 - the lights are those big metal industrial lamps left over from the factory days but the

31:55 - light they throw is dim a lot of shadows in this room

32:01 - maybe it's to enhance the view you're at the top of the building so

32:06 - one wall is floor-to-ceiling windows and when you look out you have a perfect view of well the parking lot about three

32:13 - stories below some of the old cement works machinery but also the east river

32:20 - rikers island and brothers island and queens and if you crane your head just

32:26 - out the edge you can see the lights of manhattan

32:32 - there's somebody seated at the head of the table on the opposite side of the room

32:38 - and he's waving you over standing next to him is

32:43 - a giant an absolute giant of an individual easily seven maybe seven and a half feet

32:51 - tall barely fits into his leather jacket

32:57 - someone's seated at the table next to him too she wears what looks like he used to be

33:05 - designer clothing you might maybe dior but it's dirty and it's hanging and almost

33:13 - rags from her body and she seems to be very obsessed

33:19 - with her long dark sharp fingernails she's not looking at any of

33:25 - you seated at the table

33:33 - is richter medium length brown hair great chin

33:39 - a retro suit not as new and sharply cut as rey's

33:45 - older fashion but it suits him

33:52 - i haven't got all night what impression do you want to make

33:58 - ray with your body language your attitude your posture

34:04 - what do you want to convey i was initially leaning toward

34:10 - intimidation but the seven foot guy has me reconsidering

34:16 - um i think this is going to become more of

34:23 - a uh it's it's not apologetic whatever it is

34:30 - it's pretty relatively casual

34:37 - i'm gonna stay casual okay

34:45 - let's have um composure is not your best attribute

34:52 - but no it's not let's make it um composure and street wise everyone's at

34:58 - hunger one so one of the dice in your pool will be a red hunger dye

35:09 - zero no successes so you have options ray

35:15 - you are here to answer for whatever it is richter thinks you've done

35:21 - you are trying to stay casual yeah but you can feel your

35:26 - beast already at your heart

35:32 - urging you not to back down to show confidence dominance even

35:37 - now you can listen to the beast you can

35:43 - burn a point of willpower and re-roll that black dye

35:51 - and those are your only options i think think the beast might be right

35:59 - this time so yeah the body language changes

36:04 - you've got swagger square your shoulders yeah this is his fault look him in the

36:10 - eye predator to predator okay

36:16 - margo what impression do you wish to give what do you want them to think when they see you uh

36:22 - margot understands innately that like the soft cell is the easiest one so

36:29 - she's going to look as pretty and demure and non-threatening even to the point of uh pushing her

36:36 - blush of life to just give a little bit of that pushes a prey instinct

36:43 - on predators but look men love women that seem like prey

36:49 - so interesting whatever

36:56 - well first things first you're going to call upon the power of your blood to mimic the functions and appearance of mortal

37:02 - life so that's a hunger check make a rouse check and see if you get hungrier

37:07 - nope i'm good you're good so you're still at one hunger now

37:13 - let's see how well you succeed let's make it charisma and

39:18 - amount of calm you are unruffled this is all in a night's work for you yeah

39:24 - um let's make it composure

39:29 - and subterfuge we'll do

39:41 - ah four successes four successes is very very good

39:49 - if you're troubled if you're upset they can't tell

39:54 - my turn

40:00 - okay

40:05 - all their reactions are different the giant looks at you

40:10 - as though he's ready to go right this second as you walk closer toward the head of the table you can see

40:16 - that under his leather jacket he's wearing a t-shirt that reads stay relevant

40:22 - and he never takes his eyes off you he looks like he's gonna get ready to

40:27 - move between you and richter if he has to

40:33 - richter narrows his eyes as he looks at you margo as though he can't decide if what

40:39 - he's seeing is real calculated for his benefit but his expression suggests that maybe

40:46 - he doesn't care which is which

40:53 - richard glances at you serif and he almost rolls his eyes but not quite

41:00 - and then he looks back to margot

41:06 - the kindred with the long black nails stops contemplating them for a moment

41:12 - looks up she's looking through a cascade of

41:18 - black hair hanging stringy lengths she practically has to part her hair to

41:24 - see you

41:36 - great she begins tapping on the table

41:41 - with one of her talent-like nails

41:46 - that's when richter stops looking at margot and looks

41:53 - at her and he leans in to whisper something to her

41:59 - she stops but she keeps looking at you isaac

42:07 - well that's quite an entrance you're the new licks yeah and richter do you want to tell me

42:13 - what the hell the other night airbox moves when you speak

42:19 - he steps out from behind richter's chair and gets in front of you

42:24 - and he makes a big show of how far down he has to look at you

42:35 - oh i'm sorry i didn't realize that we were standing on ceremony here so i will just explain this one more time

42:43 - very slowly so both you and you can understand this

42:49 - when you say a set up a fake charity auction for money laundering you are not

42:55 - supposed to invite people who can actually buy the things that you're auctioning off

43:00 - you are supposed to buy all of them that's how you get

43:05 - the money that you have that's how you can use your now clean

43:11 - money did you buy all of the things no who bought the other things cause that's

43:18 - how much money you lost because you decided to invite some bigwigs

43:24 - that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard and yes here i am trying to explain the

43:32 - basics of money laundering to someone i honestly thought i wasn't gonna have to explain

43:38 - this to oh wow do you have my money

43:46 - your money is somewhere on your high roller guest list

43:52 - i would love to go back into manhattan and get it for you but unfortunately you know full well why i can't do that yeah

44:00 - i know so what is the plan now we're gonna try

44:06 - this again and do it right this time because right now i

44:13 - i don't know i hadn't decided when i brought you here i was gonna

44:19 - let you make it up to me but now i'm reconsidering make it up to you

44:25 - make it up to you okay hey ray yeah can you give me a favor and shut the [ __ ] up we just met you taking

44:31 - cleansing breath i'm sorry no are you having this conversation

45:00 - supposed to know what lapel pins i don't know like a tattoo or something like oh that one sounds like that oh

45:06 - careful i'd be careful anything to me like i'm sorry

45:12 - i'm sorry okay look if there's just like some something like if there was like a social media

45:19 - for this like oh here's who belongs to who i don't know i'm gonna stop talking

45:24 - um in the hopes that i do not dig myself into as big a hole as my friend right here we're not friends i don't know him

45:32 - and whatever you do has nothing to do i'm gonna stop i'm gonna stop i'm gonna stop

45:38 - consuela did you give them the tour did they see the tanning salon yeah okay

45:43 - all right good wasn't sure i guess i'm gonna have to

45:50 - be a little bit more specific but we'll get to that

45:57 - love your work thank you not on my buildings i know i i i had no idea

46:03 - honestly if if if i had known that that supple blank brick wall

46:10 - was yours i wouldn't have touched it obviously but you know me it's like i got two beasts inside me there's the one

46:15 - that wants to feed and there's the one that wants to tag and i just

46:21 - i'm sorry good

46:26 - i'm gonna pull out my photos i appreciate that but i will if i have to i understand and i respect you good

46:37 - good evening good evening isaac

46:43 - you i'm surprised at why you've been around a couple of years you

46:48 - should know better than to do what than to take up residence in somebody

46:55 - else's turf without so much as a hello well i mean we ain't the camarilla here

47:01 - we don't have the six traditions hospitality whatever [ __ ] that [ __ ]

47:07 - is very important i understand but the thing was i didn't know i was in your turf considering the place was given to

47:12 - me who by someone

47:21 - who's in charge of me you ain't released yet

47:28 - nothing's formal can i ask what's it what what really the chair recognizes the the beautiful

47:35 - margot what's up margot curtis again i'm sorry release what does that mean can i ask am i allowed to ask questions

47:43 - pretty informal here so far thank you yeah so the deal is that uh when one of us gets

47:50 - made or turned or embraced or whatever there's often a relationship between

47:57 - what they call the child and the sire the the maker and the maki okay and i mean that can go a hundred

48:04 - different ways bad good and everything in between sometimes you know there's an extended

48:10 - period of uh what do you want to call it apprenticeship right and uh until the child is

48:16 - formally ended or with the released you know

48:21 - graduates yeah yeah how long does that normally take that's between the sire

48:26 - and the child but like everyone has that no no no

48:32 - okay it's not it's was more common not in

48:37 - modern times okay oh well let's be clear it's super camera

48:43 - it's super camarilla yeah across the river you know that's how it's done it's very formal

48:49 - [ __ ] that but you didn't know that i was in your turf no that you were

48:56 - supposed to come say hello no i didn't if i'd known i was in your turf i would have absolutely come and said hello but

49:01 - i didn't i was little overwhelmed by the situation

49:08 - considering all the changes

49:21 - looks up and peers through her long black scraggly hair each of you

49:32 - lizzy is that dior 2016 it looks great

49:38 - it used to be

49:48 - what oh my god i think

50:00 - she looks at each of you in turn snapping her jaws at rey blowing a kiss to margo

50:07 - rolling her eyes as serif and apparently a little disturbed by isaac

50:13 - she turns to richter and nods

50:18 - okay let me explain reality to you

50:27 - south bronx is mine and every lick in it owes me one night a month that's your

50:33 - rent you can pay it in many different ways money's good i like money but

57:14 - drawing on a building and losing him hundreds of thousands of dollars no wait

57:19 - not saying hello is a very very important thing saying hello in the politics that come with being a kindred

57:26 - is very important it is i don't think i'm disagreeing in fact i think i'm saying that it is very

57:31 - important because it's on par with what i did right i think you want to feel more important than us

57:37 - yeah do you see a suit yeah i see i do see that i know isn't he sharp he is quite sharp i think

57:43 - we wouldn't be alive if we weren't important interesting i don't really go that far

59:46 - take it out on somebody you're right i've seen airbox twist the head off kindred it's not uh

59:52 - what is this one-handed or two-handed well i mean you know it's hard to um

59:58 - so two-handed yeah cool why do they call him air box pretty sure every time he gets a in a fight there's a hole in a

1:00:04 - speaker afterwards it's more it's like it's a motorcycle term i'm not sure okay why don't you ask

1:00:44 - when she says nosferatu does she mean like the movie yeah very similar think

1:00:50 - oh right hakkata um yeah hikato uh you know how you have plans you have something do you

1:00:57 - know who you do you know what clans are do you know what you are do you know roughly i've got a rough understanding

1:01:04 - of some have it better than others and well yeah but some do different things yes some do different things a good

1:01:09 - place to start so in the world of kindred there are

1:01:15 - clients okay which are bloodlines oh okay oh different uh

1:01:21 - i would use the term genetic paths but it doesn't really apply um

1:01:27 - for example my clan is called zamitsy

1:01:33 - uh i don't know what you are what are you what do you do what can you do what can

1:01:38 - any of you do and i can guess i can uh can i do shimmery

1:01:46 - i'd like to create an illusion yes please what kind of

1:01:51 - illusion what do you want to produce i would like to produce a little rat

1:01:58 - that waves and then disappears hmm

1:02:04 - so let's roll manipulation and obfuscate

1:02:10 - isaac yes composure and wits please

1:02:18 - margot and rey as well

1:02:23 - composure and wigs two successes okay two successes

1:02:31 - also two successes

1:02:37 - one success one success um quick question though for

1:02:42 - high functioning addict was my last meal of my chosen type

1:02:49 - yeah yes and you are still feeling the effects from it now that will add another dye

1:02:57 - i'll just but that doesn't add anything so still only 160 still a success

1:03:05 - when your hackles get up it just ruins your night yeah yeah

1:03:11 - two successes two successes for margo too successive for you as well

1:03:17 - now make a rouse check to call upon the power of your blood to create the illusion just the one

1:03:24 - correct vessel failure oh you can't get a bestial failure on a

1:03:29 - hunger roll only on a normal dice pool but what you're telling me is it came up skull and failure correct okay

1:03:38 - why are you bothering with these trivialities my child my dear my sweetest

1:03:48 - um you're wasting your time again i disagree

1:03:56 - you never take anything seriously that is not true i take not taking things seriously very

1:04:01 - seriously such a disappointment

1:04:08 - you know what would be amusing bite him no

1:04:14 - what just sink your fangs into him and take a big

1:04:21 - hit he's unusual his clan's strange

1:04:26 - we're strange i'm strange oh you have no idea

1:04:33 - so two two one

1:04:41 - first there is nothing on the floor of the elevator and then there is a big mangy brown rat

1:04:47 - seeming to have come from nowhere oh it races forward a couple of feet

1:04:57 - stands next to your foot and waves its little talon paw at you

1:05:02 - hello hello that's quite clever and then it isn't there anymore

1:05:09 - well i can do that interesting i don't know what you are

1:05:15 - that makes two of us that demonstrates regardless of my knowledge of her clan or not

1:05:22 - clan has different abilities now the hakkata are um someone called them unpleasant they tend

1:05:28 - to deal with things that are dead oh okay in a manner of different ways

1:05:36 - so uh that's what our friend we met coming out of the elevator was was a hakata unfortunately

1:05:42 - we don't have a lot of dealings with hakata they're pretty an insular group they stay together they

1:05:49 - don't really deal with the outside unless specific instances like we were just in so

1:05:54 - um but she said we could come see her we did say we she could come see she said we could come see her

1:06:00 - yes so maybe we'll do that yeah now do any of you have transportation

1:06:08 - you have my car i took the subway get this house on the subway as well

1:06:13 - i pull out my phone sure you've um you've lived in the bronx all of you long enough to know that port morris

1:06:21 - is just the next neighborhood over from hunts point just to the uh to the southwest

1:07:22 - who drove could just leave your cars here for the evening and we could all take one car saying that was easier and you took the subway so you made you need

1:07:27 - transportation otherwise it's about 20 minute walk it's near where i live so it's convenient

1:08:45 - no you do not we good not yet this isn't i'm not going out of my way to take you

1:08:58 - driving you all the way across town for no reason other than you needed to go then you might owe me something

1:09:05 - it's a very very boiled down version of how things work but generally speaking for

1:09:10 - non-annoyances you wouldn't tell me anything note it the driver exits the car

1:09:17 - what's he look like isaac ah michael is a very slim

1:09:22 - small man who has very unruly curly hair

1:10:32 - almost ignoring michael he backs off and lets you take care of the door

1:10:37 - a gentleman interesting look

1:10:43 - some things carry over from uh our previous lives

1:10:49 - i respect that you're right yeah something like that yeah

1:10:54 - all in and all aboard then uh michael here's the address now

1:11:00 - uh what we just went through is not um at least from what i understand is not uncommon uh riku is in charge of this

1:11:07 - area and we are all existing in the area he is in charge of so we have to pay fealty as it were now unfortunately we

1:11:14 - did come in at a disadvantage so we have to make up for it a little bit but hopefully this goes by smoothly and we

1:11:20 - can get this done and then be on our way and then hey looks like we get territory

1:11:25 - that sounds fun like do we each get our own or are we sharing i think

1:11:30 - that's up to richter hmm okay but i'm trying to assume it's going to be one place

1:11:37 - michael drives and he's good at it he handles the car professionally

1:11:42 - he's been doing this for a while

1:11:48 - you guys ever see baby driver oh my god i love that this is like that yeah it is like that his shoulders twitch a little bit

1:11:56 - when he hears that i'm sorry do you not like that movie it's a very good movie yeah boss you heard the news

1:12:03 - callahan's dead i did hear i did hear that's very interesting yeah richter is probably going to be doing

1:12:10 - some um power grabbing as well as any other big person in the uh

1:12:15 - area but i mean unless they actively do something with us it doesn't really matter we're

1:12:20 - hearing some stuff people are upset i'm sure they are not that upset hmm

1:12:27 - nobody liked him no no one liked him all right so uh i dropped you off here or what uh yeah if you wouldn't mind

1:12:47 - what a dump i know judgment seems like a

1:12:53 - good place to pause our vampire story for now

1:13:13 - hey everyone i'm yev here from new york city now victor sent me out here to do

1:13:18 - some tech work for a friend of his i haven't quite met up with them yet but uh but either way very exciting to be sent on location now back to the blazing

1:13:33 - uh the nice thing about it is i tend to retain my memory out here back on the west coast uh

1:13:39 - i would lose entire days uh which was super strange uh and very weird uh but

1:13:45 - victor never seemed to be bothered by that in my memory lapses so that was good it didn't affect my employment

1:13:50 - which is great i love everything about it uh i guess and well anyway now that we're out here in the big apple uh i'm

1:13:57 - i'm helping some of his friends or at least i'm supposed to be hopefully soon when they reach out but um i wanted to

1:21:49 - so [Music]

1:22:09 - we move our scene now to port morris

1:22:15 - the southeast of the south bronx the next neighborhood over from hunts

1:22:21 - point not a long drive uh city guidebooks would probably call this a

1:22:26 - mixed-use neighborhood there are a few tenement style apartment buildings and public housing complexes

1:22:33 - and even a handful of dilapidated old brownstones but most of the structures here like in

1:22:39 - hunts point are huge factory and warehouse buildings constructed in the 19th century for

1:22:46 - easy access to the railway yards the neighborhoods bifurcated by the

1:22:52 - i-278 splitting it in half in the eastern half where you just came from

1:22:57 - everything seems to exist in the shadow of bridges and overpasses and railroad

1:23:04 - trestles elevated structures that encircle the neighborhood almost surround it

1:23:12 - but like most neighborhoods in the bronx port more seems to be changing

1:23:18 - the borough council has launched projects to revive the waterfront establish much needed green space

1:23:25 - improve housing and encourage a small but growing arts community here

1:23:31 - growth of another kind is happening in the western half of the neighborhood

1:23:36 - luxury condominiums are rising and probably along the riverside

1:23:41 - right next to the industrial structures fueled by big real estate dollars with dreams of

1:23:49 - even bigger profits michael has

1:23:54 - pulled the car up across the street from your destination the gotham cab company

1:24:01 - this grubby exhaust stained little building seems to be a combination garage and dispatch and secure parking

1:24:08 - lot for a small fleet of taxi cabs the exterior of the building is

1:24:14 - unremarkable and relatively poorly maintained it's a low unpainted brick structure

1:24:22 - it's got one of those big garage-sized roll-up doors that admits cars into the repair bay

1:24:29 - sizable parking lot off to the side surrounded by a chain link fence with a lot of

1:24:35 - barbed wire around the top you can see several dozen yellow cabs in

1:24:41 - there all in various states of disrepair there's a big plastic sign on the fence

1:24:48 - that says taxi driver is wanted the buildings to either side of the dispatch are

1:24:54 - vacant and for lease the garage door is rolled up so you can see the interior of the building

1:25:01 - see straight inside and inside the main structure is a large open

1:25:07 - repair bay with a couple of those hydraulic lifts for raising cars up so you can fix them

1:25:13 - tables and lockers for the drivers in the corner dispatchers counter and there's a

1:25:19 - few doorways in the far side of the bay from here across the street in the parked car it's hard to see that kind of

1:25:25 - detail doesn't seem to be a lot in the way of physical security around here

1:25:32 - this place looks like it would be easy to bust into you don't even see any security cameras

1:25:37 - anywhere standing silhouetted

1:25:45 - just inside the big bay doors those open garage doors facing the street

1:25:50 - a couple of men wearing leather jackets zipped up against the cold

1:25:56 - dark trousers one of them is watching the street very attentively

1:26:04 - the other is texting on his mobile phone you don't see anybody else on the street

1:26:09 - and there's no other activity in the taxi dispatch which is strange this place should run 24 7. so there should

1:26:16 - be drivers mechanics dispatchers but it's just you

1:26:23 - and the men in the doorway the distant roar of the expressway michael if you would pull up a little um

1:26:32 - just down the street a little bit so we can not you gotta buy park directly there

1:26:37 - and um keep the car running if you would keep it running

1:26:43 - and i text angela to meet me outside of the car

1:26:49 - and um all right appears we're here and these people

1:26:55 - may not be friendly so are there any animals around

1:27:00 - roll down the car window letting a blast of cold new york night air into the car

1:27:07 - well looking up and down the street you don't oh wait a minute

1:27:14 - there's a couple of dogs foraging in trash cans around there i'd like to do a feral whispers to see

1:27:20 - if they saw anything so

1:27:25 - it's a rouse check while she's leaning over us from the middle seat you know what i'm going to

1:27:32 - get out and uh make sure that you do want to talk to them directly or just not i can talk to them

1:27:39 - they might why not so

1:27:46 - the two dogs leave off their dining excursion and

1:27:51 - come trotting over to the car where you're leaning out the window you have exited the car

1:27:57 - and angela has arrived what are the what do your passengers see

1:28:02 - when angela approaches the car angela is a tall very

1:28:08 - strongly built woman has a very deeply tanned skin and about

1:28:16 - shoulder length curly hair and um has a scar that runs down the side of her face here

1:28:22 - and is looks like she could give um what's his name that we met earlier

1:28:30 - okay airbox i run for his money she is ripped as it were um and she's wearing uh

1:28:37 - a big coat and you know looks very much like someone who um

1:28:42 - knows how to handle herself in a fight you notice that she has

1:28:47 - very very small things um not like

1:33:22 - so um to any of you

1:33:29 - are any of you uncomfortable with violence uh i haven't personally witnessed a

1:33:35 - whole lot i imagine in this situation the answer is probably no

1:33:46 - it wasn't gonna turn into a whole thing i mean look let's see if we can do it without it no of course i have no do you look at me i don't

1:33:52 - fight but she does yeah yes which is why i have her okay no it's fat um

1:34:00 - so let's go and i just start walking towards the men at the garage

1:34:06 - so you've all possied up followed by angela with the dogs not too

1:34:11 - far away in fact they begin to trail you at a distance hopeful that where there was some food

1:34:17 - maybe there will be more you never know as you get closer you can begin to see

1:34:22 - details through the open roll-up door the two men

1:34:29 - are still standing just inside it the one who is observant clocks you

1:34:34 - immediately and you can see him shift his stance a little bit the other one

1:34:40 - still texting on his phone and his associate has to nudge him a little bit before he realizes that there are

1:34:45 - people approaching through the

1:34:51 - garage door you can see that one of the doorways in the interior

1:34:58 - leading away from the maintenance bay is marked office and another is marked that's so dirty it's hard to say

1:35:05 - storage just like no climate control in here there's no heat you notice now that the

1:35:11 - men's breath can be seen in the night air they are mortal

1:35:19 - a lot of radio equipment piled up on a countertop it's been dismantled and reassembled over the years in the

1:35:26 - concert effort to keep it running without replacement you don't know how this place still exists in the era of

1:35:31 - rideshare but you don't see anybody else still

1:35:37 - it's just the two men do you work here

1:35:46 - yeah wonderful place is closed that's unfortunate it seems like a weird

1:35:51 - time to be closed for a taxi company well it is closed so

1:35:58 - well seeing as you're here even though it's closed i was wondering if you could give us a hand really quick we're

1:36:03 - looking for someone

1:36:09 - they could take a look at you a little bit more closely now you didn't hear me it's closed

1:36:15 - no i heard you i'm just asking you for a favor

1:36:20 - look buddy what

1:36:27 - who are you people at the

1:36:32 - at the look buddy i'm gonna activate eyes of the beast

1:36:39 - protein power so

1:36:44 - which apart from giving me the ability to see in the dark and making my eyes glow and

1:36:51 - do weird funky awesome things it does add some bonus intimidation against mortals

1:36:58 - it certainly does those of you who are observing can see rey's eyes

1:37:04 - change dramatically they glow red

1:37:09 - not like laser pointers like a cat might chase but lurid hellish

1:37:16 - bestial red and i kind of just step in behind isaac

1:37:23 - next to isaac and say look my friend is asking you for a very

1:37:31 - simple favor won't take much of your time you haven't even heard who i'm looking for

1:37:38 - it could be you i don't know your name are you trying to intimidate him ray

1:37:43 - yeah okay let's do it um you are let's make it um

1:37:50 - it's not an obvious show of strength but let's make it manipulation and intimidation

1:37:57 - and add dye add dice from uh your protein power eyes of the beast

1:38:09 - need to be two successes okay

1:38:17 - five successes five successes he takes a step backwards

1:38:23 - through the open garage door his associate looks confused

1:38:28 - back and forth between you gino gina what's up when i catch the associate that is

1:38:34 - looking back and forth when he looks back at me i go why don't you help us and i use

1:38:40 - domination that sounds like mesmer is in power pulling out all

1:38:45 - the toys i get hungrier

1:38:54 - isaac darling you know how famished i am and i'm cold

1:39:00 - couldn't we just eat him just a little taste yeah you want to no i absolutely knew

1:39:07 - but at this very moment it would be quite inconvenient i said eat him do it

1:39:14 - do it now it would be impolite you and your manners

1:39:24 - so i believe so what is your uh mesmeric uh command you said help us why don't

1:39:31 - you help us why don't you help us his eyes go wide and his pupils dilate

1:39:38 - and you can see the struggle inside him now

1:39:44 - you've been kindred long enough to know that this usually works

1:39:49 - without any compunction whatsoever they just do what they're told

1:39:56 - but that's not happening right now interesting make a manipulation and dominate role i

1:40:01 - love this role i'm going to take intelligence and resolve i like your odds but let's see what

1:40:07 - happens uh you will need to beat two successes that's fair i got four

1:40:16 - he loses the struggle

1:40:23 - boss is in the office great thank you so much yeah yeah come on in thank you yeah help yourself

1:40:58 - perspiration has begun to be on his forehead buddy don't come near me

1:41:04 - don't touch me you don't you monster don't you don't do don't you worry about it don't you worry about it one thing

1:41:11 - my tailor asks far too many questions for me to make a mess right

1:42:43 - okay gino the terrified one

1:42:48 - keeps backing up as you approach as you come into the door he shrinks away he

1:42:53 - trips over some tools on the floor and goes flat on his back ah no no don't bite me at this point i

1:43:00 - have lost all eye contact with him and just moving towards ignoring him he cowers

1:43:06 - and cringes away until he reaches the edge of the service pit underneath the car lift and he jumps down in to get

1:43:14 - away from you there's a crash he's knocked over some equipment some tools oh crap my knee and i'm sure he'll brag

1:43:22 - about that escape for weeks to come the other individual

1:43:28 - the one that you mesmerized merely stands aside

1:43:34 - thank you would you like to introduce us yeah yeah you want you sure you're here to

1:43:50 - and he opens the door to the office serif you're headed for the storage room yes

1:43:57 - opening the door yes now multiple things happen at once

1:44:05 - behind the door to the office you see hmm

1:44:13 - it's cluttered it's a jumbled mess papers and file folders everywhere

1:44:18 - boxes one of those old-fashioned metal hot water radiators that apparently doesn't work ancient

1:44:25 - mini-fridge in the corner a rotary phone in the desk a wall calendar that's outdated by like three years

1:44:32 - and there's a slight uh looks like a middle-aged person in with short dark

1:44:37 - curly hair seated at the rickety desk two individuals

1:44:44 - on either side of him also dressed in leather jackets and slacks must be the uniform of the night

1:44:51 - but the seated individual's hand is attached to the desktop by means of a large knife that's been shoved through

1:44:58 - it there are some bruises on his face that

1:45:03 - look very very painful he stares at you wide-eyed gritting his

1:45:10 - teeth trying not to shout one of the men has a hand on his shoulder

1:45:17 - and the other hand he has a baseball bat his compatriot on the other hand

1:45:22 - is rifling through one of those aluminum briefcases

1:45:27 - you know the kind that's supposed to be indestructible right the instant he sees you he snaps it shut

1:45:35 - good evening meanwhile in the storage area you see something completely

1:45:41 - other there are four or five people back here a couple people uh dressed in uh looks

1:45:47 - like dirty coveralls covered in grease and oil and uh looks like there's a

1:45:53 - rather elderly man wearing one of those news boy caps thick spectacles

1:45:59 - and uh there's another man in a leather jacket and he's holding a gun on them

1:46:06 - which one of these drexler [ __ ]

1:46:12 - the guy with the gun shoots you there's a gunshot that echoes through the small taxi dispatch

1:46:20 - bang so you want to get out of the way i would like to well aren't there people behind

1:46:25 - you no you're all right no no yeah i will stay where i am stay where you are all right so you're not

1:46:32 - gonna try to dodge out of the way no

1:46:40 - hmm well it's a hasty shot and you're lucky he was moving too quickly to take proper

1:46:47 - aim a bullet hits you you take only one point of superficial

1:46:52 - damage ow so make a slash through an empty box

1:46:58 - on your health track the people inside shout

1:47:04 - scream some of them run out another door in the back one of the ones wearing mechanics

1:47:09 - overalls jumps the guy with a gun and they start wrestling back in the office

1:47:15 - i would like to whatever i need to roll two have not flinched at the gunshot

1:47:20 - hmm let's make it composure and streetwise great ray what's your plan

1:47:26 - uh i'm intending to activate toughness and go to grab the guy who shot at sarah

1:47:34 - you want to push past her um

1:47:39 - if if the the guy in the coveralls is already struggling i'd you want to get in there and help yeah it but it's not

1:47:46 - as as rushed as pushing pastor or walk around in okay what about margot

1:47:51 - uh if i see you moving towards him specifically i think uh

1:47:56 - she would try to make eye contact with leather jacket and just say okay put that away before someone gets

1:48:02 - hurt and is also going to try to use mesmerize okay

1:48:08 - complicated four successes to not flinch you don't

1:48:13 - move a muscle cool as a cucumber good evening uh i apologize if i am

1:49:39 - what do you want to tell him to do uh just put the gun down and settle down we'll talk this out

1:49:49 - two successes two successes four success and four successes it's almost as though he's torn between

1:49:56 - fighting back and doing what you told him to do so he settles for both he drops the gun

1:50:03 - i'm i'm just gonna hold him you want to grapple with yeah hold him uh facing uh fuego you got two

1:50:11 - successes yeah it's a tie but tie goes to the active character which is you in this case so

1:50:20 - you and the mechanic are trying to hold him the door in the storage room is open now and you

1:50:26 - can see that there's an alley out there through which the people have fled

1:50:31 - back in the office i take off over them with a briefcase and i'm going to leave angela to deal with the baseball bat man deal with the

1:50:38 - baseball batman what about serif at this point i'd like to try and take the bullet out of wherever it hit me

1:50:45 - abdomen abdomen okay i'm gonna just reach in and pull that out did you want a souvenir or

1:50:51 - yeah maybe i'll make a necklace out of it well you are undead

1:50:57 - your fingers can find the hole and dig around inside it's

1:51:03 - not too far in there and you pluck it out

1:51:10 - for later wild

1:51:16 - guy with baseball bat and angela get into it here you hear the sounds of a fight

1:51:22 - behind you as you race out the back door he's ahead of you he's gone down the

1:51:29 - alley i would like to know the minute he looks back at me

1:51:35 - doesn't seem like he's that stupid okay so i charge after a clutching briefcase

1:51:41 - moving off down the alley fast as he can go great let's make it strengthen athletics we're gonna do three rounds

1:51:48 - and out here what that means is we're gonna limit this contest we're gonna time box

1:51:53 - it to three rounds so we're trying to accumulate successes here uh first roll

1:52:00 - is athletics and strength i get one success best failure bestial

1:52:08 - failure oh well this is more like best situation

1:52:14 - are there any successes in the role none just a skull do you wish

1:52:20 - to burn willpower to re-roll anything i could i'll do that

1:52:25 - i got plenty to spare so take a point of superficial willpower damage as you double your efforts one

1:52:32 - success one success

1:52:40 - but the role is a failure and the hunger dies a skull yes

1:52:46 - well he got two successes so it's still a bestial failure okay

1:52:53 - refusing to be outclassed by this goon

1:53:00 - the beast takes control that briefcase

1:53:05 - is yours and yours alone no other hands or claws

1:53:14 - must touch it no one else is allowed to possess it

1:53:20 - you must have it every role you make that is not in service of possessing

1:53:26 - that object is it minus two dice great you must establish ownership

1:53:33 - wonderful at all costs so what i'm going to do is i'm going to have you make a second roll for the

1:53:39 - pursuit but i'm going to add the difference from the compulsion to the roll so two

1:53:46 - extra dice do you also want to um expend

1:53:52 - power of your blood yes i would i always forget to do that um yes i will rouse check to do that

1:53:58 - and i get hungrier yes now now i get what i want right

1:54:04 - we're going to drink him dry oh and taste the case oh it's very possible excellent

1:54:11 - i cannot wait to taste him quite a lot of dice

1:54:18 - ah one two three four five successes five successes

1:54:25 - he will need all successes in order to no he did not get all successes so

1:54:31 - you tackle him and before you can stop yourself you find that you are smashing

1:54:36 - his face into the pavement of the alley again and again and again until he loses

1:54:43 - his grip on the briefcase and it goes sliding down the wet

1:54:48 - pavement stones now he stops moving

1:54:55 - i am going to drink as well you sink your fangs

1:55:01 - into him right where his neck joins the shoulder tearing aside his leather jacket to get

1:55:07 - a better grip gulping down fresh goblets of pumping blood

1:55:12 - how much do you take points does that say your hunger it doesn't fully save my hunger

1:55:19 - but it brings me to let him live i will let him live it is in fact

1:55:26 - delicious you can smell the taste of fear and you can

1:55:31 - taste it on your tongue is he

1:55:37 - unconscious oh he is now great he's also badly hurt

1:55:43 - wonderful i pick up what is mine i leave you clutch

1:55:49 - the case the compulsion fades and you hear your beast

1:55:56 - sigh in ecstatic satisfaction

2:07:59 - compulsion is over yeah the case is yours it is and

2:08:05 - look there's nothing important in it right just give him his stupid little briefcase back

2:08:11 - now what what oh this ought to be good come on

2:08:27 - look the deal is i get those to the people who want them i get paid you are not in a negotiating position no my guy

2:08:34 - he did just offer up a very useful piece of information there are people who want what's in this case

2:09:00 - bargain with us we're here to do a thing which was on that letter regardless of anything else that happened we have to

2:09:06 - accomplish that and i don't really feel like giving you this back because i worked really hard for it

2:09:11 - he's got two minutes okay this ain't gonna end well all right

2:09:19 - do it quick and i take the what is now essentially a blade and just right through the wrist

2:09:25 - so using your inches long razor sharp finger talons the feral weapons

2:09:34 - how many successes ah six rather a lot really

2:09:40 - sufficient to rather messily not quite in one sweep
