Built from <a href= "https://github.com/just-the-docs">just-the-docs</a>

Big WIP, still in the troubleshooting phase. I'm real bad at jekyll so if you have any ideas on how to modify anything absolutely hmu on <a href="https://mqole.tumblr.com">my tumblr</a> or open a pull request

## Known issues/to-do list/whatever
- Change colour of text in search bar (no idea how to do this.)
- Just-the-docs `callout` css is broken.
- External links in `_config.yml` do not display
- **figure out why it works locally but not on gh pages I GUESS.**
